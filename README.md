# SHIFROM

End-to-end encrypted Android messaging with censorship-resistant transports,
field-tested against carrier-grade DPI (TSPU) on specific Russian mobile networks
and configurations. These tests do not establish universal resistance to filtering.

## What is SHIFROM?

SHIFROM is an open-source messenger for people who cannot assume their network is
neutral or trustworthy: journalists, activists, dissidents, and anyone who believes private communication is a human right.

The project combines a familiar modern messenger experience with explicit
security and censorship-resistance boundaries:

- end-to-end encrypted 1:1 messaging and encrypted voice notes;
- multiple network paths selected at runtime, without requiring a separate VPN or third-party circumvention app;
- an untrusted store-and-forward relay that handles ciphertext and necessary routing metadata, not message plaintext;
- public architecture decisions, threat modeling, known issues, and development history.

SHIFROM implements X3DH, Double Ratchet, and Sealed Sender-inspired protocol layers
over libsodium primitives. This is custom protocol code, not `libsignal-client`,
and it has not received an independent third-party cryptographic audit.

### Naming transition

The messenger is now named **SHIFROM** following a trade-name conflict. This
change does not mean that the new name has completed independent trademark
clearance, or that the software has received a security audit.

The public website is [shifrom.com](https://shifrom.com), and current contact
addresses use `@shifrom.com`. The approved SHIFROM logo and Android display
name are on `master`. The bilingual website and donation links are published;
the [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/shifrom) and
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/SHIFROM/) profiles use the current branding.
The [Codeberg mirror](https://codeberg.org/VladislavLiudvig/SHIFROM) is also
named SHIFROM; its former repository URL redirects to the new one.

Working service endpoints and published cryptocurrency addresses remain
unchanged. Historical release notes, installation identity, signing continuity
and protocol/storage names are preserved for compatibility and reproducible
evidence. Source branding does not mean that an installed app has been updated:
the renamed signed APK still needs its device upgrade and user-flow checks.

## Status

**Current stage:** Alpha 2, active development on `master`.

**Latest tagged pre-release:** [`v0.1.0-alpha.2`](https://github.com/LiudvigVladislav/SHIFROM/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.2).
The tag is a historical snapshot from 2026-04-30; development on `master` has moved
substantially beyond it. Both Alpha releases remain on the [Releases page](https://github.com/LiudvigVladislav/SHIFROM/releases).

**Production relay:** [`relay.phntm.pro`](https://relay.phntm.pro), a Rust/Axum
service that stores and forwards encrypted envelopes. It can still observe timing,
size, authenticated sessions, and delivery destinations.

**Call relay:** `turn.phntm.pro`, a dedicated coturn service used only when
direct ICE cannot connect the peers. The application obtains short-lived TURN
credentials through an authenticated relay session; the long-lived operator
secret is not shipped to clients.

### Working on current `master`

- **End-to-end encrypted 1:1 text** with prekey bootstrap, X3DH, Double Ratchet,
  Sealed Sender envelopes, Safety Numbers, and QR contact exchange.
- **Adaptive transport selection** across Direct WSS, embedded Xray VLESS+REALITY,
  and Tor v3 onion. Tor is deliberately text-only.
- **REST send/poll fallback** when a carrier passes HTTPS but silently drops or stalls long-lived WebSocket traffic.
- **Encrypted voice notes:** XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, bounded chunk upload,
  a ratcheted media manifest, and receiver reassembly. The media + REST path has
  been exercised on Tele2 LTE.
- **Per-user signed-challenge authentication**, encrypted Android storage
  (SQLDelight + SQLCipher), store-and-forward delivery, disappearing messages,
  message edit/delete, and conversation mute/pin.
- **Crash- and reconnect-safe outbound recovery:** queued ciphertext is replayed
  in deterministic order, ratchet settlement is fail-closed before new
  encryption, and supported control events commit atomically with archived
  session advancement.
- **Durable production relay queue:** accepted envelopes survive relay process
  and container restarts. The completed heartbeat-echo diagnostic is disabled
  in production.
- **Authenticated TURN fallback for 1:1 audio calls:** direct ICE remains the
  preferred media path; a physical phone on LTE and an emulator on Wi-Fi
  sustained a 6m18s relayed call with intelligible audio in both directions.
- **Current Android release baseline:** target API 36, fail-closed production
  signing, and verified 16 KiB ELF alignment for every bundled 64-bit native
  library.

### Honest Alpha boundaries

- The custom cryptographic protocol composition is not independently audited.
- Groups and calls have code and UI surfaces, but are not yet production-ready
  release features. Calls still need a two-physical-phone network matrix and
  audio-quality validation without emulator or acoustic-feedback ambiguity.
- Tor is an emergency text path, not a media or realtime-call transport.
- Field validation proves specific devices, carriers, routes, and dates—not every carrier or future DPI policy.

### Roadmap by horizon

- **Next:** finish Android design parity and a new signed Alpha candidate,
  broaden Direct/REST field validation, complete two-physical-phone call and
  audio-quality validation, reduce first-contact latency, stabilize groups,
  and add encrypted photo/file attachments using the existing media pipeline.
- **Beta:** harden 1:1 voice/video calls across direct and TURN-assisted network
  paths, add a desktop client, expand pluggable transports, and design
  linked-device identity.
- **v1.0:** iOS client, public channels, a rate-limited username directory,
  supported self-hosted relay packaging, and an independent security audit.
- **Post-v1 research:** BLE/Wi-Fi Direct mesh, Kademlia DHT routing,
  federation experiments, and post-quantum migration.

[development journal](docs/PROJECT_LOG.md) for the detailed state.

Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the short overview and
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the module and data-flow
walkthrough. Architectural decisions are indexed in
[docs/adr/README.md](docs/adr/README.md); especially relevant are
[ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-Crypto-Library-Decision.md),
[ADR-016](docs/adr/ADR-016-tor-unified-push-hybrid-transport.md),
[ADR-019](docs/adr/ADR-019-Xray-REALITY-Outer-Transport.md), and
[ADR-020](docs/adr/ADR-020-Adaptive-Transport-Selection.md).

## Threat model

SHIFROM is designed around an untrusted network and an untrusted relay. The
formal model is in
[docs/threat-model/Threat_Model_v0.md](docs/threat-model/Threat_Model_v0.md).

The current design aims to protect against:

- passive network inspection of message content;
- a compromised relay reading correctly encrypted messages or media;
- retrospective decryption of earlier traffic after later ratchet-state
  compromise;
- endpoint blocking and DPI through pluggable transport paths that have been
  field-tested on specific networks and dates;
- offline extraction from a locked Android device through encrypted local
  storage and platform-keystore protection.

It does not claim to protect against:

- an unlocked or malware/root-compromised endpoint;
- coercion, social engineering, or a malicious conversation partner;
- a global observer correlating timing and volume at multiple network points;
- every future censorship technique or every carrier configuration;
- undiscovered flaws in the unaudited custom protocol implementation.

Direct transport reveals a connection to the relay. REALITY changes the
observable wire shape but is not an anonymity system. Tor provides the strongest
current network-origin hiding and is restricted to text. Review
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) before relying
on Alpha software for a high-risk use case.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development and validation
workflow.

## Deploy your own relay

The repository contains the operator deployment used for SHIFROM's relay,
including Caddy, Axum, Tor, Xray/REALITY, and supporting services. It is an
Alpha-stage reference deployment, not yet the supported v1 self-hosting kit.

Start with [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md). Before exposing a relay, replace
operator-specific domains and credentials, review firewall and persistent-state
requirements, and build a client configured for your endpoint.

## Contributing

Contributions and adversarial review are welcome, especially in cryptography,
transport field testing, Android reliability, threat modeling, accessibility,
and documentation.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request. For a
large feature or trust-boundary change, open an issue first so the design and
required ADR can be agreed before implementation.
