# Privacy Mode — Feature Comparison

**Status:** Approved 2026-05-05 by Vladislav (founder)
**Audiences:** product team · marketing · in-app onboarding · external review
**Companion:** behaviour spec at `docs/spec/PRIVACY_MODE_BEHAVIOR.md`

---

## A. Visual identity

In-app icon assets are **custom-designed, not emoji**. They live in the design system and are referenced by name from this document. Engineering bundles them as vector drawables in `apps/android/src/androidMain/res/drawable/`.

| Mode | In-app icon asset | Marketing emoji fallback | Tier | Tagline (≤ 7 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | `ic_privacy_mode_standard` (current placeholder: Lucide `Globe`) | 🌐 | Free, default | "Normal messenger, with E2EE by default." |
| **Private** | `ic_privacy_mode_private` (current placeholder: Lucide `Lock`) | 🔒 | Free | "Quieter. Discoverable only by people you know." |
| **Ghost** | `ic_privacy_mode_ghost` (current placeholder: Lucide `Ghost`) | 👻 | PRO | "Invisible. Anonymous. Ephemeral by design." |

The "current placeholder" column lists the Lucide icon used until Vladislav exports finals from the design system. Once the custom assets land in `Design/`, the drawable resources are swapped without any Kotlin change — the resource IDs (`R.drawable.ic_privacy_mode_*`) stay stable.

Icon usage rules:
- **In-app onboarding cards:** custom asset at 32 dp alongside the mode title. **Never emoji.**
- **In-app Settings → Privacy Mode summary row:** custom asset at 24 dp next to current mode label. **Never emoji.**
- **Foreground notification (Android shade):** the small icon stays the SHIFROM mark — no per-mode icon. The notification text alone conveys mode.
- **Marketing site / app store / grant-application markdown:** emoji acceptable (web rendering, cross-platform consistency). When the marketing site moves to a CMS-managed image set, prefer the custom assets exported as web SVG.

## B. Compact differentiator table — for marketing & app store

This table is rendered cross-platform (web, app store description). Emoji are used here for visual quick-scan; the in-app version uses the custom icon assets from §A.

## D. "When to choose which mode" — UX text

Used as helper copy on the onboarding selection screen, in the Settings → Privacy Mode chooser, and in marketing site comparison block.

### Standard 🌐
> **Choose Standard if you want SHIFROM to feel like a normal messenger.**
> You can be found by username, your contacts can see when you are online, and calls work as you would expect. Every message is end-to-end encrypted by default — that does not change in any mode.

### Private 🔒
> **Choose Private if you want a quieter presence.**
> Username search will not find you — only people who already have your identity key can reach you. Read receipts and typing indicators are off by default; turn them on per setting if you want them. Everything else (calls, groups, attachments) works normally.

### Ghost 👻 (PRO)
> **Choose Ghost when anonymity matters more than features.**
> You disappear from SHIFROM's social layer. Your messages self-destruct after 24 hours by default. All your traffic is routed through Tor with bridges — slower, but invisible to your network provider.
>
> The trade-off: voice and video calls are unavailable in Ghost mode, and group chats are not supported. This is by design — calls and groups would expose information that contradicts the anonymity promise.
>
> Ghost is part of SHIFROM PRO.

## E. PRO value proposition (for billing screens & marketing)

Ghost is the headline PRO feature, but PRO unlocks more than mode-switching alone.

**Free tier (Standard + Private):**
- Full E2EE messaging, voice messages, calls, groups, attachments.
- Self-hosted UnifiedPush wakeup (no Google FCM, no Apple APN).
- Auto-fallback to Tor when network conditions require it.
- SQLCipher at-rest encryption.
- One device per identity (Alpha 2) → multi-device (Beta).

**PRO tier adds:**
- 👻 **Ghost Mode** — invisible profile, always-Tor, 24h disappearing, no push, no backups, no calls, no groups.
- (Beta) Plaintext-only-in-RAM storage for Ghost.
- (Beta) Multiple identity profiles per app install.
- (Future) Hidden service hosting for self-managed relay scenarios.
- Priority support contact.

The PRO upsell exists because Ghost mode imposes ongoing operational costs (Tor onion service hosting, bridge availability, custom WS keepalive infrastructure) that a tiny minority of users actually require. Free users get full E2EE messaging without compromise — Standard and Private are not crippled versions of Ghost. They are the right tools for most people.

## F. External-positioning differentiation language

For the "What makes SHIFROM different" sections of public write-ups, project comparisons, and external proposals:

> SHIFROM is one of very few messengers that ship a **layered privacy model** — three coherent privacy contracts (Standard, Private, Ghost) that map to four orthogonal subsystems (discovery, presence, push, transport) through a single user choice. Each mode is a complete product promise, not a setting toggle. The strongest tier (Ghost) provides anonymity guarantees comparable to Briar or Cwtch — running over Tor with bridges, no third-party push, no group surface — while the everyday tier (Standard) provides a normal messenger UX at no privacy cost beyond what Signal-grade E2EE already provides.
>
> The architectural decision to embed Tor + Lyrebird pluggable transports (Snowflake / WebTunnel / obfs4 / meek) inside the application itself, rather than relying on a separate Tor app such as Orbot, means SHIFROM works for users in censored networks without requiring them to discover, install and configure a second tool. This is critical for users in Russia, Iran, China and similarly restricted environments where multi-app onboarding is itself a privacy hazard.

---

## G. App-store listing snippet (Google Play, F-Droid, App Store)

Short version (≤ 200 chars), suitable for app-store descriptions:

> Three privacy modes — Standard, Private, Ghost — let you choose how visible you are. End-to-end encrypted always; Ghost adds Tor + bridges + 24h disappearing messages.
