# SHIFROM — Project Log

> Internal development journal. Captures **state, decisions, and history**
> in one place so any contributor — or any future Claude session that
> walks in cold — can pick up exactly where the previous one left off.
>
> **Maintenance rule.** At the end of every significant working session,
> append a new entry to the [Session journal](#session-journal) with the
> date, goal, what shipped, what was rejected and why. Keep entries
> reverse-chronological so the freshest context is at the top.
>
> User-facing release artefacts (`README.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`) live at the repo root;
> formal architectural decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](adr/); this log is
> the in-between layer that ties them together with the human story of
> "why are we doing what we're doing right now".

> **Terminology note, 2026-09-17.** Entries below use "production-validated"
> and similar wording for what were founder-run acceptance runs against the
> live deployment, usually on a single device, carrier and date. That was an

### 2026-10-08 · SHIFROM naming transition (draft)

- **Decision:** I am changing the messenger's public name following a
  trade-name conflict. This is not a trademark-clearance or infringement
  determination.
- **Repository:** I renamed the GitHub repository to SHIFROM, preserving
  its owner, identity and history.
- **Draft scope:** I am updating current Android and public source copy
  from a clean master-based branch, without including accumulated unrelated
  development changes. I am retaining installation, signing, protocol,
  persistence and operating-address compatibility.
- **Pending:** replacement logo and activation of `shifrom.com`, including
  corporate email migration. I have not merged, deployed or updated a
  device as part of this draft.
- **Checkpoint:** development and call validation remain paused; historical
  journal entries below are unchanged.

See [the naming-transition scope](tracks/shifrom-brand-transition.md).

### 2026-09-21 · Residual N1 and Android release-readiness baseline

- **Merged:** PR #411 outbound recovery, PR #412 Android 16 KiB page-size
  support, and PR #413 API 36 release finalization.
- **Runtime validation:** clean installs on a physical Android 12 phone and an
  API 37 / 16 KiB emulator; onboarding, contact setup, bidirectional text, and
  read receipts passed.
- **Release validation:** signed APK/AAB, production certificate, Bundletool,
  APK signature, zip alignment, and all 64-bit ELF load alignment checks passed.
- **Still active:** Android design parity, production relay rotation to the
  already-merged durable queue, expanded capability smoke, and a final signed
  presentation candidate.
- **Scope boundary:** this entry does not claim groups or calls are
  production-ready and does not claim an external cryptographic audit.

See [`project/STATUS_2026_09_21.md`](project/STATUS_2026_09_21.md) for the
current concise snapshot.

## Current state

**Released:** `v0.1.0-alpha.2` remains the latest tagged historical pre-release.
**Branch state:** `master` is the integration target; current reconciled baseline is `88bf5ed` after PRs #411-#413.
**Production:** `relay.phntm.pro` serves the current Alpha deployment, but its running relay image predates the durable-queue merge in PR #397. Rotate and attest the image before treating restart persistence as a production property. `phntm.pro/terms` and `/privacy` serve themed HTML in EN + RU.
**Licensing:** AGPL-3.0-or-later established as the formal project
licence (LICENSE + NOTICE + SPDX headers on every .kt and .rs file +
README §License — all shipped in the four-commit licence-hygiene
patch on 2026-04-27).

### What works today (master `88bf5ed`, 2026-09-21)

This block summarizes capabilities present on `master`; production activation is stated per item. Coverage spans the Trek 2 Stage 1.x → 2A → 2B-A → 2B-B → 2B-D long-poll backbone delivery, the Sprint 2b OPK lifecycle + pending/active session work, the T2 carrier-ceiling prekey-publish bug close, the voice transport-independent confirmation, the DWS-UX telemetry baseline + ADR-011 honesty pass, and the R3.6 sticky-per-route Fast REST degradation. Capabilities added or hardened since the 2026-05-21 baseline below:

- ✅ **Trek 2 long-poll backbone LIVE on production** — `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS > 0` and `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` deployed; Stage 2B-D release flag `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED` flipped `"0"` → `"1"` in PR #320 so release APKs activate the Round 14 paced padded poll path (4×1152 byte chunks ~300 ms cadence, canonical `byteCount=4608`). Stage 1.x server prerequisite (`seq_mac` HMAC tag, atomic `RestTokenStore::issue()`, `MAX_POLL_HOLD_SECS_CAP=480` dual-layer clamp, `PER_IDENTITY_HOLD_CAP=3` CAS-bounded) shipped in PR #303. Stage 2B-B client implementation (10 client locks L1-L10) shipped in PR #309.
- ✅ **OPK lifecycle + pending/active session foundation** — Sprint 2b A/B/C (PRs #315/#316/#317): factory-lambda re-snapshot in `PreKeyApi.publishBundle`, two-phase DEFERRED OPK consume + `opk_reservation` + `pending_ratchet_state` companion + cap-8 LRU + pending-coordinated sweep, runtime promotion + outbound pending-INITIATOR reuse via `bootstrap_artifacts_blob`. ADR-029 added. Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE integration smoke PASS 2026-06-16 (all three layers — Round 14 wire + Sprint 2a guard + Sprint 2b-C inbound-repair, zero `OpkNotFound` / `fail_mac action=hold` / `promotion=false`).
- ✅ **T2 carrier-ceiling prekey-publish bug CLOSED** (PR #323) — Two-layer fix: Layer 1 `AndroidNativeOkHttpPreKeyPublishTransport.publish()` unconditional skip-body on 2xx; Layer 2 `PreKeyApiClient.publishWithRetry()` 201 branch synthesises `Stored(storedOpks=0)` on empty body. Post-merge sanity smoke PASS on Tecno Tele2 LTE: 701 ms total wall-time (vs 186 000 ms pre-fix), all 4 FAIL signals = 0. The reliability backbone is now functionally complete for the current alpha surface.
- ✅ **Voice notes on Tele2 LTE field-confirmed** (PR #325) — ADR-028 §"Layer 3" "voice = REST media" + multi-transport framing 2026-06-09 verified on the media payload. 4 voice notes (9-15 chunks each) sent Tecno ↔ emu over Tele2 LTE, all `message_ready path=AUDIO_LOCAL`, media errors = 0. Voice manifest envelope delivered through the long-poll backbone while the emu did 14 WS ↔ REST mode switches and Tecno hit `ws_ping_timeout_diag=32`.
- 🟡 **R3.6 sticky-per-route Fast REST degradation merged in PR #328 + field-validated, release-disabled** — Ordered `WsSessionLifecycleEvent` channel with guaranteed enqueue, supervised single-collector dispatcher, sticky-recovery state machine with `lastObservedEpoch` monotonic floor and 60-second `ws_alive_60s` probation. Field-validated 2026-06-21 on Tele2 LTE → Wi-Fi route change: Mode 2 detected at 31 s, 10 dead WS sessions with ZERO flap, two REST deliveries with decrypt OK, exact 60-second Wi-Fi recovery probation, `wifi-A` via `ws_deliver_in` on the recovered Direct. **Release flags `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` and `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` stay literal `"0"` post-merge — R3.6 is INACTIVE on production builds and awaits a separate rollout PR after the next-track reconnect-quiescence work lands.** Debug opt-in via `localOrEnv("fastRestMode2"/"modeSticky", ...)`. NOT a Direct WSS stability fix; protects the user-visible delivery path from `Frame.Text`-driven flap, nothing more.
- ✅ **DWS-UX telemetry baseline + UX honesty** (PR #327) — `ws_ping_timeout_raw` raw counter, REST overlay actual `TransportKind`, Error-label discriminator (transport-fail vs delivery-fail), `retryWaitingMessages` source field. ZERO actuation in this PR. ADR-011 honesty pass (PR #326) aligns four track docs with the post-PR-R0.4a actuation posture.

### What worked at the 2026-05-21 baseline (master `8f4c68c9`)

This block reflects the production state at the 2026-05-21 baseline, after the M1w / M2 / H1 / H2 / D-track / REC sprints. Capabilities since then are summarised in the "What works today" block above. The Alpha-1 baseline immediately below is preserved as a historical reference point.

- ✅ **End-to-end encrypted 1:1 messaging** — Double Ratchet + Sealed Sender via libsodium; identity-prekey separation per ADR-009 implemented; F22 prekey private-key wrap via Android Keystore (ADR-023 Accepted, PR #56 `d862f3d0`); F8 Double Ratchet state wrap (ADR-024, PR #60 `cc48a333`); H2b idempotent envelope ledger (PR #129 `7008cf3e`) neutralises relay redelivery.
- ✅ **Multi-transport stack with runtime gating** — three transports plus a fallback layer:
  - **Direct WSS** (`Standard` mode) — the primary path on healthy networks; H1c/H1e Run C policy locked (PR-H1c `e946caba`, PR-H1e `bcc501be`).
  - **Reality (VLESS+REALITY through Xray)** (`Private` mode) — load-bearing on RU mobile carriers per the 2026-05-15 strategic pivot follow-up; Stage 5E production-validated 2026-05-07.
  - **Tor v3 onion service** (`Ghost` mode) — text-only emergency fallback per pivot. PR-E imported Briar's `bridges-s-ru` bridge set + Google-AMP-cache Snowflake (Test #6 reached Ghost-without-VPN on МТС in ~6 min).
  - **REST short-poll fallback** (PR-D0r relay endpoints + PR-D1/D1b/D1c/D1c.1/D1d client orchestrator) — activates automatically when WS realtime degrades. Tested end-to-end on Tele2 LTE Иркутская.
- ✅ **Encrypted media-upload voice messages 1:1** (M1w end-to-end). Record → encrypt (XChaCha20-Poly1305 AAD=mediaId) → chunk → upload via native OkHttp fresh-client-per-call → manifest envelope via ratchet → receiver durable enqueue + ACK + GET + decrypt + SHA-256 verify + bubble. PR-M1w (#172 `561de17c`) plus the M2a–M2h.1 sequence locked production chunk size = 3200 bytes, byte-based early manifest = 5100 bytes, ~3× throughput headroom vs the v2 ceiling.
- ✅ **Recording Panel UX trilogy** — RecordingPanelState enum with Recording / Paused / Locked / SwipeCancel states. REC1 baseline (PR #195 `08ccf906`), REC2 WhatsApp-style hold-to-lock + recorder crash hardening + swipe-left-cancel safety shim (PR #197 `52a9773f`), REC3 SwipeCancel state visual + threshold/trail/animated arrow (PR #205 `770e61f4`).
- ✅ **Outgoing voice upload cancel** — X glyph on the uploading bubble actually stops the upload via `MessagingService.cancelVoiceUpload` + `CancellationException` propagation + `NonCancellable` cleanup + `job.cancel + join` (PR-MEDIA-UPLOAD-CANCEL2.1 in PR #198 `b117dcb9`).
- ✅ **Per-user Ed25519 signed-challenge auth** (F11+F26 closed via PR #72 `6e90e3c6`; ADR-027 Accepted). Replaced the shared WS token; production-validated on Tecno МТС + emulator 2026-05-09.
- ✅ **Trust Tier flow** (first message → Message Requests, accept → Trusted) — unchanged from Alpha-1.
- ✅ **Production relay** with store-and-forward at `wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws` plus the REST endpoints `/auth/session`, `/relay/send`, `/relay/poll`, `/relay/ack-deliver`, `/prekeys/publish`, `/prekeys/status`, `/media/v3/{mediaId}/{idx}` POST + GET.
- ✅ **QR code + `phantom://invite/<base64>` deep links** — unchanged from Alpha-1.
- ✅ **Crypto integration test suite green** (16/16 on Pixel 8 Pro / API 35); H2b storage contract + messaging tests green; D2b.1 voice durability tests green; M1w/M2 tests green; D0r REST-fallback integration tests green.
- ✅ **Foreground-service WebSocket** with WifiLock + partial WakeLock + AlarmManager-driven 45 s proactive reconnect.
- ✅ **Onboarding ToS** in EN, full Terms / Privacy Policy hosted at `/terms` and `/privacy` with EN ⇄ RU switcher (unchanged from Alpha-1).
- ✅ **Settings → About** with all 6 contact addresses (unchanged from Alpha-1).
- ✅ **Discipline scaffolding** — `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` codifies single-developer discipline (one active track, one PR per layer, mini-lock before code, two architectural failures = park, hand-off note on context switch, log everything, log-not-develop on new findings). First PR-end-to-end under that discipline = REC3 (PR #205) plus PR-DOC-HONESTY (this PR).

### What works (proven in QA-v10 / 2026-04-27) — historical Alpha-1 baseline

Preserved as the original snapshot at tag `v0.1.0-alpha.1` (commit `0246b50f`). Read alongside the **What works today** block above to see what changed.

- ✅ End-to-end encrypted 1:1 messaging (libsignal + libsodium, Double Ratchet, Sealed Sender)
- ✅ Trust Tier flow (first message → Message Requests, accept → Trusted)
- ✅ Production relay with store-and-forward at `wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws`
- ✅ QR code + `phantom://invite/<base64>` deep links
- ✅ Crypto integration test suite green (16/16 on Pixel 8 Pro / API 35)
- ✅ Foreground-service WebSocket with WifiLock + partial WakeLock
- ✅ Onboarding ToS in EN, full Terms / Privacy Policy hosted at `/terms` and `/privacy` with EN ⇄ RU switcher
- ✅ Settings → About with all 6 contact addresses (security/support/privacy/legal/abuse/press)
- ✅ Chat input bar inset handling fixed across Tecno HiOS and stock Android (root cause: `enableEdgeToEdge()` instead of `setDecorFitsSystemWindows`)

### Known limitations (documented)

See [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the full
register. Headline items:

- ⚠️ **ISSUE-001** Tecno HiOS / aggressive-OEM Android skins reconnect every ~60 s due to OS-level Wi-Fi radio parking. **Mitigated** to 1–3 s message-delivery latency through WakeLock, OkHttp `pingInterval(8s)`, `forceCancelAllEngineCalls`, `cancelAndJoin`. **Real fix** scheduled for Alpha 2 via Unified Push (FOSS, no Google).
- No iOS / desktop / web client.
- No voice/video calls (scaffolding present, signalling not wired into UI).
- No attachments.
- No groups (state machine + Sender Keys crypto present, not on the Alpha 1 surface).
- No Tor / BLE / Wi-Fi Direct transport.

## Active backlog

The four GitHub Issues drafted in
[`docs/alpha2-backlog.md`](alpha2-backlog.md)
are the Alpha 2 priority queue:

1. **Onboarding ToS review** — final wording approval after lawyer / GDPR review.
2. **Per-message status indicators** (Sending / Sent / Delivered / Read) — wire signals already exist on the relay path; UI bug is purely client-side.
3. **Encrypted profile sync** (Alpha 2 protocol slice) — first/last name and bio visible to contacts; new `ProfileUpdate` envelope type.
4. **Locale-aware date-of-birth picker** — replace plain text field with proper `DatePickerDialog`, locale-aware display formats.

Also tracked:

- ⏳ Legal review by qualified attorney (Wyoming / US privacy law)
- ⏳ GDPR review for EU compliance (Art. 13/14 disclosures)
- ⏳ Russian translation review for legal-terminology accuracy
- ✅ ~~`LICENSE` file at repo root matching the AGPL-3.0 intent of [ADR-006](adr/ADR-006-Crypto-Library-Decision.md)~~ shipped 2026-04-27 (`e99aac0e` + `c403b7cf` + `27cd9bd1` + `0bc715e1`)
- ⏳ External funding programme submission (target window 2026-06-01)
- ⏳ Locale-aware in-app linking from Onboarding to `/terms/ru` / `/privacy/ru` based on `Locale.getDefault()` (currently always English)

## Decision log

This section records **rejected** options as well as accepted ones —
otherwise we would re-litigate the same conversations every few weeks.

### Accepted: SHA-1 application restriction for Firebase API key (instead of full key regeneration)

**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Context:** Phase 1 repo cleanup (commit `f07bba8c` + follow-up
`9b0581dd`) removed `apps/android/google-services.json` from git
tracking, but the live Firebase API key shipped inside that file was
publicly visible in every commit between project inception and the
cleanup PR. Two paths to mitigate:

- **A.** Restrict the existing key by Android package name + signing
  certificate SHA-1 fingerprints (debug + release). The leaked key
  remains usable, but only from APKs signed with our keystores. Other
  callers see `403 API_KEY_RESTRICTED`.
- **B.** Regenerate the key entirely. The leaked one is fully
  invalidated; clients with the old key (i.e. every existing PHANTOM
  install) lose FCM push until they receive an updated APK with a fresh
  `google-services.json`.

**Decision:** Path A (restrict, do not regenerate).

**Why:**

- Firebase keys are publishable by design — the Android SDK literally
  bundles them into every APK that ships, so they are extractable from
  any release with `apksigner` + a hex editor. The threat is not
  secrecy, it is *abuse*: someone using our key to exhaust our FCM
  quota and DoS our push channel. Application restriction
  (Android-package + signing-cert SHA-1) is the canonical mitigation
  Google itself recommends.
- Path B's blast radius hits real users: every install in the field
  loses push notifications until they update. Pre-Alpha-2 user count
  is small but non-zero, and the disruption is asymmetric to the
  threat (we have no evidence the key was actually scraped).
- Restoring the security posture is now reversible — if we later see
  abuse on the leaked key, we can still execute Path B (regenerate)
  without losing any of today's restriction work.

**Implementation:**

- Generated SHA-1 fingerprints from both keystores via `keytool -list -v`:
    - Debug (`~/.android/debug.keystore`):
      `B2:9E:30:6F:1F:77:83:AB:83:76:E3:EE:DB:AA:D2:AE:98:6D:74:5A`
    - Release (`keystores/phantom-release.keystore`):
      `A3:2B:94:CA:3A:85:C6:A1:CF:0E:8F:48:A2:86:C5:D9:64:AE:61:D9`
- Added both as Android-app application restrictions on the Firebase
  auto-created Android API key in Google Cloud Console
  (`console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=phantom-app-a1ca0`).
- Also added the matching SHA-256 fingerprints to the Firebase Console
  app registration page (defence in depth — Firebase Auth, Dynamic
  Links, App Check use these for client-attestation independently of
  the API-key restriction above).

**Follow-up:** if `gradle :apps:android:signingReport` ever shows a
new SHA-1 fingerprint (e.g. release keystore rotated, additional CI
signing key introduced), it must be added to both the Google Cloud
Console restriction and the Firebase Console app registration *before*
distributing the new APK. Otherwise that build will hit
`403 API_KEY_RESTRICTED` on first FCM register.

### Rejected: server-side Tor outbound for Stage 5E (Path B)

**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Context:** Stage 5E's Hetzner Xray VLESS+REALITY server needs to forward
the unwrapped client traffic somewhere. Two architectures were on the
table — Path A (forward straight to clearnet `relay.phntm.pro` on the
same VPS via docker bridge DNS) and Path B (run a local Tor inside the
Xray container, route through a `.onion` to the relay).
**Why rejected:**

- Path B adds 500–800 ms per WebSocket frame on top of the REALITY
  handshake — unacceptable for messenger UX.
- The defence-in-depth Path B promises (Hetzner Xray operator can't
  correlate `client X → relay Y`) is moot because the Hetzner Xray
  operator IS the relay operator. Same VPS, same hand on the keyboard.
- Adds another daemon (Tor) to the production stack — more attack
  surface, more maintenance, more failure modes for the on-call rotation.

**Replacement:** Path A — `dns.hosts: {"relay.phntm.pro": "caddy"}` in
the Xray server config sends VLESS-tunnelled traffic straight to the
Caddy container over the docker bridge network. Zero NAT hairpin, zero
extra latency. Acceptable trade because external observers see only the
REALITY-mimicked Microsoft TLS handshake; the relay-operator-as-attacker
threat is out of scope for this server (it's defended at the Double
Ratchet layer instead — relay sees only ciphertext).

**See:** session entry for 2026-05-07 (Stage 5E production-validated).

### Rejected: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for push-on-disconnect

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Tecno HiOS reconnects every ~60 s. FCM would let the relay
push silent data wakes to the device when the WS dies, eliminating
client-side reconnect cost.
**Why rejected:**

- FCM token = Google-issued stable trackable identifier per install. Adding
  it to PHANTOM puts a Google-known identifier on every account, which
  contradicts ADR-001 (zero-third-party-metadata) and the entire
  "we cannot disclose what we do not have" posture in the Privacy Policy.
- Each push = metadata event Google sees: "device X received PHANTOM message at time T".
- Public-interest funding programmes that align with this project
  specifically fund privacy/freedom tech. A Google dependency in the
  core delivery path damages that narrative.
- Self-hosters of the relay would be forced to provision a Firebase project.

**Replacement plan:** **Unified Push** (FOSS protocol, ntfy.sh / gotify
distributors, no central provider). Scheduled for Alpha 2.

**See:** session entry for 2026-04-27 (FCM scaffold removed in
uncommitted local work; never reached master).

### Rejected: server-driven heartbeat Text frame (commit `22a76c22` reverted in `b2447dde`)

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Tried to keep cellular DPI / firewalls happy by having the
relay send `{"type":"heartbeat","ts":<unix>}` every 30 s as visible
application traffic.
**Why reverted:**

- Did not fix the Tecno-HiOS case (carrier DPI was never the cause —
  see "OEM Wi-Fi radio parking" finding below).
- Introduced a regression on the previously stable Pixel emulator: with
  the heartbeat branch in `tokio::select!` interleaving with
  `socket.next()` / `socket.send()`, the emulator's WebSocket started
  dropping after ~3 minutes (37 successful pings then a
  SocketTimeoutException). Almost certainly a subtle interaction with how
  the actor drains pending writes during heavy bidirectional traffic.

**Lesson:** when one mitigation does not work, **revert it and re-test**
before stacking another mitigation on top. Two mitigations interacting
hide root causes.

### Accepted: input-clipping root fix is `enableEdgeToEdge()`, not `setDecorFitsSystemWindows`

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Context:** Earlier the chat input slid under the 3-button nav bar on
Tecno HiOS. Two attempts to fix it via Compose `Modifier.windowInsetsPadding`
both failed.
**Root cause:** `WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(window, false)`
turns on edge-to-edge **drawing** but does not install the
`OnApplyWindowInsetsListener` Compose needs for `WindowInsets.ime` /
`WindowInsets.navigationBars` to be populated. The Pixel emulator
installed that listener as a side effect of other init paths so things
worked by accident. Tecno HiOS does not, so every
`Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(...)` resolved to zero.
**Fix:** replaced with `enableEdgeToEdge()` (the AndroidX-managed wrapper
that combines the decor-fits flag with the inset listener Compose
expects), guarded to API < 35 because on API 35+ the system enforces it
and re-calling corrupts the EGL surface.
**See:** commit `d2320b95`.

### Accepted: `socket.split()` was the relay's PONG-flush bug

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Context:** Even after fixing the client-side OkHttp graceful-close
60-second hang (`b14b39ff` → `2ee1d08d`), the phone was still dropping
its WebSocket on a deterministic 60-second cycle.
**Root cause:** Ktor's `OkHttpWebsocketSession.outgoing` is an actor
whose internal `WebSocket` is a local variable, not a field. The actor's
finally block calls `websocket.close()` (graceful) which blocks for
OkHttp's hardcoded `CANCEL_AFTER_CLOSE_MILLIS = 60_000L`. On the relay
side, splitting the WebSocket into `(Sink, Stream)` halves means the
auto-PONG enqueued by tungstenite when a PING arrives only flushes
on the next *write* through the Sink half — which never happens during
idle.
**Fix:** replaced relay's `socket.split()` + two spawned tasks with a
single `tokio::select!` loop that reads frames AND writes frames from
the same future, with explicit `socket.send(Message::Pong(payload))` on
every received PING.
**See:** commit `dbd9393c`. This was the breakthrough.

### Accepted: `Releases/` folder pattern for canonical release artefacts

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Files:**
- `Releases/README.md` — public-facing project README
- `Releases/RELEASE_NOTES.md` — what's in the release
- `Releases/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — limitations register
- `Releases/GITHUB_RELEASE_BODY.md` — template for `gh release` body
- `Releases/GITHUB_ISSUES_DRAFT.md` — Alpha 2 issue bodies ready to paste

**Why a separate folder:** the root `README.md` is the internal "Claude
Code + VS Code Pack" guide that the founder uses to bootstrap their
local agent setup. Replacing it with the product README would break the
founder's tooling. `Releases/` keeps both worlds clean.

> **Superseded 2026-04-28.** The `Releases/` folder was retired. Public
> artefacts moved to repo-root standard locations (`README.md`,
> `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`); the GitHub Release-body
> template and the issues-draft moved into `docs/release-drafts/` and
> `docs/alpha2-backlog.md` respectively. The Claude Code + VS Code Pack
> guide that used to occupy the root `README.md` was deleted (no longer
> needed in the public repo — it described the founder's local agent
> tooling, not the product). `Releases/` was also stripped from git
> history via `git-filter-repo` so the public repo presents a clean
> tree.

## Lessons learned

Technical findings worth remembering across sessions.

### Compose insets on OEM Android skins

`Modifier.windowInsetsPadding(WindowInsets.ime ⋃ WindowInsets.navigationBars)`
is the right way to pad a screen for both keyboard and system nav bar:
the `union` gives the per-side max so they never stack. **But** the
modifier resolves to zero unless the Activity has called
`enableEdgeToEdge()` (or the older deprecated equivalent). Without that,
inset values are not propagated to Compose by some OEM Android builds —
the Pixel emulator hides this by installing the listener through other
code paths.

### Ktor 3.0.3 OkHttp engine close behaviour

- `session.close()` triggers OkHttp's graceful-close path: send WS CLOSE
  frame, wait up to 60 s for the peer's matching CLOSE before tearing
  down the socket. This is the source of the QA-v3 60-second-hang
  pattern.
- `session.cancel()` is closer to right, but the OkHttp actor's
  `finally { websocket.close(...) }` still runs and blocks.
- The reliable escape hatch is to call `OkHttpClient.dispatcher.cancelAll()`
  on the *engine* — that fires `onFailure`, the actor's finally then
  sees a failed websocket and returns instantly. We expose this through
  an `expect/actual` `forceCancelAllEngineCalls()` plumbed into
  `KtorRelayTransport`.

### Stale coroutines across reconnect generations

When a generation's `pingJob` lives in a `transportScope` that the
`webSocket {}` block fails to cancel via the normal exit path (e.g.
exception path), the next generation's session can be force-cancelled
by the *previous* generation's pingJob firing late. Symptom: cascades of
"Pong timeout" log lines a few seconds after a successful reconnect.
**Pattern:** hoist the per-generation scope out of the `webSocket {}`
block and `cancelAndJoin` it in a `finally` — `cancel()` alone is
asynchronous and lets stale jobs race. Capture the session at launch
time into a local `val` so a stale job cannot read the *new* session
out of the field. Both fixes shipped in `846d6bed`.

### Caddy bind-mount semantics

`docker compose restart` does **not** pick up `volume:` changes. Only
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate` recreates the container with
the new mount config. Caddyfile changes alone (no volume change) do
get picked up by `restart` because the file is bind-mounted and Caddy

### Caddy `handle_path` matcher ordering

`handle_path /terms/ru*` MUST appear **before** `handle_path /terms*` —
Caddy matches in source order and the generic block would otherwise
swallow the localised path before the specific block sees it. Same for
`/privacy/ru*` vs `/privacy*`.

### Tecno HiOS aggressive power management

Even with a foreground service notification visible AND a partial
WakeLock AND a high-perf WifiLock, Tecno HiOS still drops the
WebSocket every ~60 s. Per the user's testing, no amount of in-app
mitigation fully fixes this — only push-on-disconnect (Alpha 2) will.
Documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md as ISSUE-001 with a Tecno-specific
workaround section (Battery → Unrestricted, etc.).

### Don't trust hallucinated git history from a separate Claude

A consultant Claude session repeatedly claimed fixes existed on
specific branches that did not (`Update Dockerfile for Rust 1.88` etc.).
Always verify with `git log --all --oneline -- <path>` before acting
on advice that references prior commits — even from another LLM.

The original 2026-05-23 ordering follows for reference:

1. ✅ **PR-DOC-HONESTY** — shipped 2026-05-21 (PR #208 + close #209).
2. ✅ **PR-UI-REC-FOLLOWUP** — shipped 2026-05-22 (PR #210 `a625bde7`). Test #77 PASS.
3. ✅ **PR-NOTIF-DIAG** — shipped 2026-05-23 (PR #213 `a0484602`). Test #78 PASS. Surfaced two new follow-ups (rows 4 and 5 below).
4. **PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1** — replaces BOTH parked PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 (PR #217) and parked PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 (PR #226). Variant A+ per Vladislav 2026-05-25: `MessageRepository.observeMessages(conversationId): Flow<List<MessageEntity>>` reactive data source via SQLDelight `asFlow().mapToList(Dispatchers.IO)` (infrastructure already in repo, never used) + bottom-anchored render carried forward from PR #226 v1.2 structural pattern. Removes 12 manual `reloadMessages()` call-sites from `ChatScreen`. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-thread-state.md` with Vladislav-locked 8 acceptance scenarios + MANDATORY pre-implementation checklist (item-order mapping, side-effect inventory, anti-pattern verification). Old `docs/tracks/chat-autoscroll.md` and `docs/tracks/chat-bottom-anchor.md` retained with PARKED hand-offs as diagnostic trail.
5. **PR-NOTIF-POLICY1** — conversation-level notification with `InboxStyle` summary + unread count + clear-on-chat-open. Closes the perezatiranie finding from Test #78. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/notif-policy.md`. Variant A vs B decision at mini-lock review.
6. **PR-D1e** — first-message bootstrap fast path (yellow-dot 10–20 s on first text after `add contact`; PR-G4 closed the 8 s × 4 timeouts but the residual ~10 s on bootstrap remains). See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` ISSUE-022.
7. **Network matrix Standard / Private / Ghost** — systematic re-verification of each transport on (a) clean Wi-Fi, (b) Tele2 LTE, (c) МТС Wi-Fi (no SIM cellular today), (d) emu-on-dev-Wi-Fi. Multi-session, multi-time-of-day; produces the `docs/project/CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX.md` public artifact.
8. **Calls testing — C-track sequence.** C1 typed `TransportCapabilities` gate → C2 Reality endpoint pool + realistic probe → C3 TURN-over-TLS on 443 or custom Opus-over-Reality.
9. **Voice quality A/B** — 24 kbps OPUS mono 16 kHz confirmed as production floor; a future "Data Saver" 16 kbps toggle is gated behind this A/B.
10. **PR-UI-SUPPORT-SCREEN — Settings → Support PHANTOM** (Vladislav 2026-05-24, "это потом"). New Settings section / dedicated screen with donation channels surfaced from `funding.json`: Liberapay + Buy Me a Coffee as deep-links opening in browser; BTC / XMR / ETH as copy-to-clipboard + QR-code for the user's wallet camera. Source of truth = `funding.json` (either hard-coded mirror or fetched from `https://phntm.pro/funding.json` — pick at mini-lock review). Foundation already in place after 2026-05-24: funding.json in repo (PR #215) + on the domain (PR #218 + #219 hotfix). No mini-lock yet — Vladislav said "это потом".
4. **PR-D1e first-message bootstrap fast path** — yellow-dot 10–20 s on first text after `add contact` (`PREKEY_TRACE upload_fail SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=8021`); same class as the H1e half-open WS pattern but on the prekey path. See `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` ISSUE-022.
5. **Network matrix Standard / Private / Ghost** — systematic re-verification of each transport on (a) clean Wi-Fi, (b) Tele2 LTE, (c) МТС Wi-Fi (no SIM cellular today), (d) emu-on-dev-Wi-Fi. Multi-session, multi-time-of-day; produces the `docs/project/CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX.md` public artifact promised in `feedback_strategy_decisions_2026_05_14.md`.
6. **Calls testing — C-track sequence.** C1 typed `TransportCapabilities` gate (replace `state == WsActive` shorthand) → C2 Reality endpoint pool + realistic probe (current `/health` probe doesn't catch the Tele2 Layer A silent WS-drop pattern) → C3 TURN-over-TLS on 443 or custom Opus-over-Reality (decide after C2 measures what Tele2 actually allows).
7. **Voice quality A/B** — confirmed 24 kbps OPUS mono 16 kHz as the production floor (`feedback_voice_quality_priority.md`); a future "Data Saver" 16 kbps toggle is gated behind this A/B.

### New follow-ups generated by PR-RECV-DIAG1 (2026-05-27, queue order locked 2026-05-28)

**Locked next-session queue order (2026-05-28, post external transport-architect review):**

1. ✅ **PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1** — **shipped 2026-05-28** as PR #241 `899d45bd`. Three architect review rounds (direction → P1 line-level → P2 final), three additive commits (`61b4da0b` → `ea9b74a4` → `b340eba5`) preserving the verification trail. Test #88 functional PASS on Tecno Tele2 LTE; critical Scenario B verified `NETWORK_TRACE changed → rewalk_start → service_restart_received → generation_claimed → fresh PROBE_TRACE chain_start`. All five mini-lock steps shipped + three guardrails enforced. See the 2026-05-28 (late) session journal entry above for full chronicle.
2. **PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1** — moved to position #2 in queue (was #1). Stale Double Ratchet state after force-stop cycles produces `Permanent decrypt failure (MAC error)` → `ack_deliver_send` → silent message loss; current only working remediation is `pm clear` (full wipe). Architect-designed 4 steps: (1) do NOT ack-deliver on MAC error in debug/beta builds, (2) add `DECRYPT_TRACE` logs covering msg id / sender / conversation / session state / x3dhInit presence / error type / action, (3) session-repair path — mark session as suspect, optionally reset local ratchet, force fresh X3DH on next outgoing, (4) a non-destructive "repair without wipe" capability so users do not lose history on the next reproducer. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/crypto-session-repair.md`. Reordered behind LTE-NETCHANGE1 because MAC-error reproducer is rare (multi-cycle force-stop) while LTE blocks daily testing on Vladislav's primary device.

### Additional follow-ups (not in the locked head-of-queue order above)
- **WS+REST duplicate envelopes** — during `WsActive ↔ RestActive` transitions the same envelope may arrive on both channels. The H2b idempotent ledger (PR #129 `7008cf3e`) catches duplicates correctly and discards the second copy, so this is **not a correctness bug** but a wasted-bandwidth / wasted-decrypt-CPU artefact. Architectural cleanup deferred until other items in the queue close.
- **Conditional REST auto-recovery test** — write an automated test that simulates a half-dead WS (frames flowing one direction only) and verifies the `InboundIdleTimeout → transitionToRest(\"inbound_idle_timeout\")` path fires within `INBOUND_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS + PING_INTERVAL_MS` and the next REST poll picks up the missing envelopes. Currently only proven by Tecno real-device behaviour; CI coverage would catch a future regression in `startIdleWatchdog` or the `inboundStalled` collector.

### Deferred individual items (not in the locked-order queue above)

The items below are tracked durably but are not on the active queue. Most have been waiting for relay-side or operations work before they can land.

- **M2e early-manifest re-enable** — depends on receiver-side media-cancel relay protocol (see `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` ISSUE-023). M2e overlap is currently disabled in favour of correct cancellation semantics; long voices ship at `max(upload, download)` instead of the M2e parallel baseline.
- **Receiver-side media download cancel** — needs the two new relay endpoints sketched in ISSUE-023 (`DELETE /media/v3/{mediaId}` + `POST /media/v3/{mediaId}/cancel-pull`). Without these, the receiver bubble's X glyph is intentionally hidden.
- **PR-INFRA-MediaRO — second relay route diversity** — deploy a second `phantom-relay` at a different VPS / ASN (FlokiNET Romania candidate); allocate a media subdomain; design `mediaRelayId` extension to `VoiceManifestV2`; re-run the PR-M2c.0 probe against two `MediaProbeEndpoint` entries. Probe code preserved on `diag/m2c0-media-route-probe`. Needs VPS budget + a decision on auth model (federated identity vs per-relay registry).
- **PR-R0.5 / PR-PK1 — prekey upload response-drop fallback** — `/prekeys/publish` POST body lands server-side (201 ~3 ms) but the 18-byte response is dropped downstream on Tele2 ~30 % of the time. Three retries currently mask it but burn 30 s × 3. Fix idea: after POST timeout, GET `/prekeys/status/<identity>` and treat the soft-success path as terminal if `opks_remaining` / `spk_key_id` advanced.
- **PR-D0r follow-up — sealed-sender empty mirror** — review note from PR-D0r round; mirror envelope to REST store with `from=from_identity` when `sealed_sender` is empty. Currently not blocking but should be closed before next REST API surface change.
- **WS keepalive on Tele2 — diagnostic open** — phone-side `inbound_frames=0 pings_received=0` across every WS session lifetime (~31 s) on Tele2 LTE. Direct WS is honest "Online via Direct · Limited realtime" because realtime is unreliable; REST fallback covers text. Not actionable today; the C-track will need to address this if WS is resurrected as a primary realtime path.
- **PR-H2c — skipped-message-keys per Signal spec** — closes the third leg of the H2 reorder story (legitimate future-message reorder from TCP retransmit pauses, multi-path mobile, Tor circuit shifts). No production reproducer of legitimate reorder has surfaced since H2b landed.
- **UI stale-bubble track** — receiver `AudioBubble` briefly flashes "Downloading" after `download_complete` on some Test #70.2 chunk-size choices; Compose state-refresh issue. Tracked separately, no urgency.
- **`docs/calls-experimental` ADR refresh** — Track A item #4 marked ✅ merged but the doc itself is out of date relative to the C-track plan; either update or formally supersede.
- **93 non-docs `[gone]` local branches** — broader prune sweep awaiting Vladislav's explicit greenlight per `feedback_branch_prune_policy.md`.

### Historical / paused

- **Phase 1 connectivity matrix (Tests #43-#47)** — paused 2026-05-15 per strategic pivot; resumes if priority shifts back. Scope reference intact in memory `project_phase1_scope_2026_05_14`.
- **Tor bridge BridgeDB-on-device fetcher** — deferred (Briar doesn't have one either — bridge freshness, not the fetcher, is the bottleneck).
- **Cross-operator testing (Beeline / Megafon)** — blocked on hardware: Tecno SIM is Wi-Fi only since 2026-05-14; second phone with mobile data still incoming.
- **Tor-bridge rotation ADR** — architect-recommended retrospective, not started.

### Pre-2026-05-21 sub-sections (preserved for context, do not re-edit)

Below this point the original sub-section blocks (Reliability / transport, Calls, Repo / docs, Historical / paused) are preserved as the durable per-track journal. The **Consolidated queue** above is now the canonical "what's next" — these blocks are the per-item evidence trail.

### Reliability / transport (D-track, post-D1d)

- **✅ PR-D2a — Voice / call UI + send-layer guard for Limited realtime.**
  Merged 2026-05-17 night as PR #162 (master `210b827f`). Two-layer
  guard: UI in `ChatScreen.onMicClick` + `onVoiceCall` (Snackbar
  refusal at gesture start + `MEDIA_CAPABILITY blocked
  feature=voice|call mode=<state> source=ui` log), send layer in
  `DefaultMessagingService.sendAudio` (`VOICE_TX blocked_limited_realtime
  … source=send_layer`) and `CallManager.startCall` (`CALL_TX
  blocked_limited_realtime … source=call_manager`). Voice guard also
  tears down an in-progress recorder cleanly if transport degrades
  mid-recording. Snackbar copy lives in `res/values/strings.xml` —
  EN-only for now to match the rest of the inline-EN chat UI (Test
  #53.1 evidence: a `values-ru/` translation just for D2a strings
  disagreed with the surrounding EN UI on RU-locale devices). Verified
  end-to-end on Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` (Tele2 LTE Иркутская) across
  Test #53 → #53.1 → #53.2. Voice on REST **is still not delivered**
  by D2a — it is refused politely instead of silently failing. The
  real fix is PR-D2b.
- **✅ PR-D2b.1 — Durable voice chunk core + sender hardening.**
  Merged 2026-05-17 night as PR #164 (master `9f1f346b`). Foundation
  layer for voice over REST: `AUDIO_CHUNK_BYTES = 8 KB → 3 KB`,
  per-chunk `transport.send()` result check (failed chunks throw,
  local row stays `QUEUED`), new `voice_chunks` SQLDelight table +
  migration `16.sqm` (v16 → v17), durable 1:1 receive path (save
  chunk BEFORE ack-deliver, assemble + insert keyed on `voiceId`,
  delete chunks on success, keep on insert failure), startup
  finalizer that resumes voices interrupted by process death, 24 h
  TTL with per-voice `VOICE_RX partial_expired` log, already-inserted
  pre-check in the helper so the finalizer cannot double-emit /
  double-notify / double-bump unread after a crash between live
  insert and previous cleanup, `deleteOlderThan` whole-voice
  semantics matching `findExpiredSummaries`, and a range guard
  rejecting malformed `chunkIndex >= chunkTotal` payloads. 10 storage
  contract tests + 5 messaging tests cover the new behaviour. Group
  voice intentionally stays on the in-memory path (no `groupId`
  column in `voice_chunks`); group durability is queued separately.
  Voice on Limited realtime is **still gated closed** by D2a — the
  durable path is wired but not yet exercised. Architect re-review
  on round 2 cleared.
- **PR-D2b.2 (next, after D2b.1).** Flip `canSendVoice` lambda to
  allow `RestActive` / `WsCandidate` so voice goes through the
  durable path on Tele2-style transports. Keep `canStartCalls`
  `WsActive`-only (REST cannot carry WebRTC realtime). Drop the
  voice UI guard in `ChatScreen.onMicClick` (`onVoiceCall` keeps
  its guard — calls remain blocked). Add 15-sec recorder cap +
  `VOICE_TX recorder_auto_stop reason=max_duration durationMs=15000`
  log. Build APK + ship Test #54 install commands. Acceptance: phone
  → emu and emu → phone 5–10 sec voice arrives on Tele2 LTE; every
  chunk `envelopeBytes <= 4096`; `VOICE_RX chunk_saved` precedes
  `ack_send_after_handler`; `assembly_complete` fires exactly once
  per `voiceId`; one voice message in UI (not N chunk messages);
  killing receiver mid-transfer doesn't corrupt chat; calls remain
  blocked.
- **PR-R0.5 / PR-PK1 — Prekey upload response-drop fallback.**
  `/prekeys/publish` POST body lands server-side (Caddy shows 201 ~3 ms)
  but the 18-byte response is dropped downstream on Tele2 ~30 s of the
  time, causing client `SocketTimeoutException` and retries. Low-impact
  because three retries currently mask it, but burns 30 s × 3 per
  attempt. Fix idea: after POST timeout, GET `/prekeys/status/<identity>`;
  if `opks_remaining` / `spk_key_id` updated to expected post-upload
  values → treat upload as success (soft-success path). **Priority: low.**
- **PR-D0r follow-up — Sealed-sender empty mirror.** Mirror envelope to
  REST store with `from=from_identity` when sealed_sender is empty
  (review note from PR-D0r round). Currently not blocking but should
  be closed before next REST API surface change.
- **WS keepalive on Tele2 — diagnostic open.** Phone-side
  `inbound_frames=0 pings_received=0` across every WS session lifetime
  (~31 s) on Tele2 LTE. Direct WS is honest "Online via Direct · Limited
  realtime" because realtime is unreliable; REST fallback covers
  text. Not actionable today — covered by D-track REST design. If C-track
  resurrects WS as a primary realtime path it must include a Tele2
  keepalive answer (server-side TCP keepalive alone is insufficient
  per Test #48 evidence).

### Calls (C-track — Standalone realtime stream)

Calls are intentionally **NOT** in the D-track. WebRTC needs a stable
realtime channel; REST short-poll cannot carry voice/video at acceptable
latency.

- **C1 — TransportCapabilities for calls.** A unified `TransportCapabilities`
  type (`text / voiceMessages / calls / realtimeUdp`) drives UI gating
  honestly. Call button must be disabled when transport ≠ stable realtime.
  Today this state is implicit; an explicit type is required before any
  attempt to ship calls on Limited realtime networks.
- **C2 — Reality endpoint pool with realistic probe.** Today `/health`
  passes but WS realtime is dead — health check is a false-positive.
  Probe must include a real WS handshake + first frame exchange and
  iterate across multiple endpoints (different IP / ASN / SNI / port).
  First stable endpoint wins.
- **C3 — Realtime call transport.** Two candidate paths, both
  blocked on C2 evidence: (A) WebRTC + TURN-over-TLS on 443;
  (B) custom low-bitrate Opus stream over Reality WebSocket with
  jitter buffer + push-to-talk fallback. Decide after C2 measures
  what Tele2 actually allows.

### Repo / docs

- **`docs/calls-experimental` ADR refresh.** Track A item #4 marked
  ✅ merged but the doc itself is now out of date relative to the C-track
  plan. Update or supersede.
- **`KNOWN_ISSUES.md` Tele2 entry.** Should add a plain-English entry
  describing the Tele2 LTE realtime limitation (text via REST works,
  voice queued for D2b, calls unsupported until C-track) so external
  users hitting "Online via Direct · Limited realtime" can read what
  it means.

### Historical / paused

- **Phase 1 connectivity matrix (Tests #43-#47).** Paused 2026-05-15
  per strategic pivot; resumes if priority shifts back. Scope reference
  intact in memory `project_phase1_scope_2026_05_14`.
- **Tor bridge BridgeDB-on-device fetcher.** Deferred (Briar doesn't
  have one either — bridge freshness, not the fetcher, is the bottleneck).
- **Cross-operator testing (Beeline / Megafon).** Blocked on hardware:
  Tecno SIM is Wi-Fi only; second phone with mobile data still incoming.
- **Tor-bridge rotation ADR.** Architect-recommended retrospective,
  not started.

### 2026-07-04 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-B2-LTE-RECON1 §12 Fable 5 architectural review + K10 → K9 → K8 sequencing (follow-up to PR #366)

**Goal.** Land the Fable 5 external architectural review pass on `direct-wss-mode2-b2-lte-recon1.md` as a durable §12 amendment. The review received the §11 Run 1 evidence closure (PR #366 `0c92d1df`) + the constraints from `C:\temp\b2-k1-k4-recon-2026-07-04\fable5-fix-family-prompt.md` and returned a ranked fix-family recommendation + two evidence-weight findings that reshape §4 and §5. This closure captures both without opening a fix-track scope-lock — that stays behind K10 + K9 + K8 gates per §12 sequencing.

**Outcome.** §4 causal hypothesis renamed `H-B2-WS-Frames-Blocked-Post-Upgrade` → **`H-B2-WS-Uplink-Frames-Blocked-Post-Upgrade`** with an explicit "downlink UNDETERMINED, pending B2-K9" clause (Fable 5 Finding 2). §5 adds three new diagnostic instruments: **B2-K8** (client-driven short-poll hold-threshold discrimination), **B2-K9** (WS server-initiated downlink probe), **B2-K10** (Caddy regression audit). §6 adds **PASS-E** acceptance gate for the post-K8 short-poll fix-candidate path (G1-G4). §9 adds calls-media (WebRTC / TURN) on Tele2 as an explicit "does NOT decide" item — future track candidate. **New §12** section captures Fable 5 review verbatim highlights: two evidence-weight findings (temporal contradiction with 2026-06-17 voice PASS + WS uplink-vs-bidirectional gap), ranked top-3 (short-poll #1, LTE route policy #2, alt-endpoint recon #3), ranked-out candidates (Reality parked / QUIC probe-only / TURN-only rejected as standalone), required K-instrument sequencing (**K10 → K9 → K8 → fix-track**), open questions carried forward, and a rollout pointer (rollout order is informational only; the actual scope-lock is authored by the future fix-track mini-lock, not by §12).

**Ranked fix-family per Fable 5 (informational; no scope-lock).** №1: client-driven short-hold poll (`/relay/poll?hold=N`, client-side, relay honours without server-side network detection; Matrix `/sync?timeout=` prior art). №2: client-side network-class route policy layered atop №1. №3: alt-endpoint / SNI / TLS-profile recon on a second VPS in a different ASN. Rejected: Reality (Arm G park), QUIC / H3 (deserves 1-day probe only), TURN-only (violates Constraint 1 — doesn't cover text).

**Required K-instrument sequencing.** Load-bearing per §12 Findings 1 + 2:

- **B2-K10** — Caddy regression audit (`phantom-caddy` image + Caddyfile `flush_interval` diff between 2026-06-17 voice PASS and 2026-07-04 Run 1). Zero-field, ~15-30 min desk audit. If a Caddy regression fell between those two dates, the REST plane of `FAIL-Wider-Issue` retracts.
- **B2-K9** — WS server-initiated downlink probe. Relay in diagnostic mode emits an unsolicited Ping or small data frame from the server side immediately after WS Upgrade completes. Closes the uplink-vs-bidirectional gap in `H-B2-WS-Uplink-Frames-Blocked-Post-Upgrade`.
- **B2-K8** — hold-threshold discrimination matrix (`hold ∈ {0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30}` seconds × ~10-15 min per step) on the same Run 1 stand. Diagnostic-only; both relay-side param and client-side knob behind debug flags. Gate PASS-E if G1 (`hold=0` produces ≥ 95 % `body_eof=1`, zero `InterruptedIOException`, breaker stays in first tier) + G2 (emu → Tecno delivery lands) + G3 (threshold-curve data captured) + G4 (voice blob download PASSes).

**Fix-track mini-lock opens only after B2-K8 PASS-E lands.** If G1 fails at `hold=0`, verdict hardens to "Tele2 breaks even short GET responses" and rank re-orders toward Fable 5's #3 + QUIC reachability probe. Fable 5's ranked list is an INPUT to the future fix-track's own facts-first scope-lock, not a substitute for it.

**Open questions carried forward.** (1) Caddy image / config diff 06-17 vs 07-04 (closed by K10). (2) Setup context of 06-17 voice PASS (same SIM / cell / tariff / relay digest as Run 1?). (3) FCM push status on Tecno / Tele2. (4) Calls media (WebRTC / TURN) on Tele2 — known unknown, not covered by short-poll. (5) `conn_id ↔ poll_call` 9 vs 25 reconciliation — belongs to the future fix-track's idempotency-gate design, not to B2 verdict closure.

**What this closure ships (docs-only).** `docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-b2-lte-recon1.md`: §4 rename + downlink UNDETERMINED clause; §5 adds K8 / K9 / K10; §6 adds PASS-E; §9 adds calls media out-of-scope; new §12 "Fable 5 architectural review + follow-up K-instrument sequencing" (~120 lines). `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`: this entry above the §11 Run 1 evidence closure entry from earlier the same day. `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md`: new entry for this PR.

**What this closure does NOT change.** No code change. Not a fix-track scope-lock (§3 restated; §12 restates). Not an override of Fable 5's ranking — the future fix-track's own mini-lock re-derives it from evidence in force at that time. No change to `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 release / rollout gate. No re-open of PR #330. No invalidation of B1 Wi-Fi closure. Release-flag posture unchanged.

**In-force lineage.** All prior lineage from the previous same-day entry stays in force. Additionally: B2 §11 Run 1 evidence closure (PR #366 `0c92d1df`) + Fable 5 external review (this closure).

**Verification.** No build change to verify. Docs-only. Voice + Cyrillic + future-date hygiene grep on diff clean.

### 2026-07-04 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-B2-LTE-RECON1 §11 Run 1 evidence closure — K1 + K4-natural + K6 → FAIL-Wider-Issue verdict candidate

**Goal.** Close the B2 mini-lock's first-deliverable evidence loop from `direct-wss-mode2-b2-lte-recon1.md` §7 with the K1 + K4-natural + K6 corpus, and amend §4 hypothesis matrix with the verdicts the evidence supports. Not a fix-track scope-lock; the mini-lock explicitly forbids that in §3. Facts-first per WORKING_RULES rule 3.

**Outcome.** §4 amended: **`H-B2-WS-Frames-Blocked-Post-Upgrade`** added as a NEW causal candidate (STRONGLY SUPPORTED); **`H-B2-Config-Mismatch`** REFUTED; **`H-B2-Carrier-NAT-Idle`** / **`H-B2-Byte-Freeze`** / **`H-B2-Age-Kill`** REFUTED as sole causes; **`H-B2-Doze-OEM`** UNSUPPORTED; **`H-B2-REST-Survives-WSS-Fails`** REFUTED; **`H-B2-REST-LongPoll-Separate-Fault`** SUPPORTED; **`H-B2-Both-Fail`** SUPPORTED (main fault-scope verdict). §11 evidence-closure section added with per-run data + durable-artefact pointers. §6 verdict candidate = **`FAIL-Wider-Issue`**.

**Run 1 window.** `2026-07-04T12:09:28Z → 12:58:00Z UTC`. Tecno BF7-12 on Tele2 LTE, emu peer on Wi-Fi. APK from master `7207593b` debug build (`sha256 fa77a24e177167bb98f1f72e66db2ba688d3c774e1c3e49ae736f87b79ecf6c9`). Release-flag posture unchanged.

**K1 — WSS baseline.** 89 WSS `session_summary` records on Tecno client-side during the 45-min soak. Every record: `duration_ms ≈ 31000`, `pings_sent=0` (app-level dead counter — real OkHttp Ping fires per the `thrown` message body), `pongs_received=0`, `inbound_frames=0`, `okhttp_successful_ping_pongs=0`, `since_last_pong_ms=-1`, `thrown='SocketTimeoutException: sent ping but didn't receive pong within 15000ms (after 0 successful ping/pongs)'`. Rhythm: WS Upgrade → OkHttp WS Ping at 15 s → 15 s wait for Pong → timeout at ~30 s → close → reconnect, 89 iterations.

**K4-natural — REST long-poll.** Mode switch to REST fired at `12:10:59.962` (90 s into soak). 9 × `REST_TRACE poll_call`, 9 × `REST_TRACE poll_fail reason=InterruptedIOException elapsedMs=~35025`, 100 % failure at ~35 s. Body arrival on Tecno: `body_chunk=95`, `body_eof=0`. Breaker cascades 21 × through cooldown ceiling.

**K6 — relay-side discrimination (smoking gun).** SSH from Windows PowerShell to `phantom-relay-01` (Git Bash's key set rejected — used PowerShell's ssh-agent-registered key). Pulled 4 slices via `docker logs --timestamps --since ... --until ...`: `phantom-relay-full-window.log` (943 lines), `phantom-relay-tecno.log` (297 lines, filtered on identity prefix `d95a9d5a3fc31afd`), `phantom-caddy-full-window.log` (617 lines), `phantom-caddy-tecno-endpoints.log` (447 lines). **WS side:** relay recorded 84 Tecno `event="session_summary"` records; every single one shows `pings_received=0 pongs_sent=0 inbound_frames=0 outbound_frames=0 echo_frames_received=0 echo_frames_sent=0 close_origin="error" close_code=0 close_error="ws_read: WebSocket protocol error: Connection reset without closing handshake" duration_ms ≈ 153000` (one outlier at 1 025 580 ms). Cross-reference: **0 hits** on `ws_protocol_ping_received` OR `ws_protocol_pong_sent` across all 92 Tecno `conn_id` values in the full-window log (marker fires 440 times for other users in the same window at the same relay). Delta 31 s (client) vs 153 s (relay) reconciled: client OkHttp fires at its 30 s ping-timeout; relay's `ws_read` remains blocked ~120 s more until the underlying TCP flow expires (Linux keepalive or Tele2 carrier drops the flow) and returns a raw RST from below. **REST side (supporting, not fully dug):** Caddy access log records Tecno `/relay/poll` as HTTP `200`, `Content-Length: 4608`, `duration: 30.9 s`; relay emits 25 × `event="rest_poll_returned"` for Tecno (vs client's 9 `poll_call` — volume reconciliation deferred). Emu → Tecno delivery-exercise message `5cc3e70b` appears in one `rest_poll_returned` with `envelope_id=5cc3e70b more=true chunked_flush=true` — relay tried to deliver, Tecno never processed.

**Interpretation.** Something between Tecno's uplink and the relay's `ws_read` loop drops or fails to route ALL WebSocket application-layer frames from Tecno after the WS Upgrade handshake succeeds. NOT selective for the WS Ping opcode — 0 frames of ANY opcode observed relay-side. Broader than the informal "Control-Frame-Filter" placeholder from `run1-analysis.md`; renamed `H-B2-WS-Frames-Blocked-Post-Upgrade` in the §4 amendment.

**Durable evidence bundle at `C:\temp\b2-k1-k4-recon-2026-07-04\`:**
- `run1-analysis.md` (client-side reconstruction, 122 lines)
- `k6-analysis.md` (relay-side discrimination, 161 lines)
- `k6-stage/` (raw relay-side log slices, 4 files, ~1.6 MB total)
- `b2-k1-k4-run.sh` (runner patched for two script bugs found during Run 1 — regex `to=RestActive` widened to `to=(RestActive|REST_ACTIVE)` for SCREAMING_SNAKE log-writer output; `grep -c ... || echo 0` multi-line quirk replaced with `count_matches()` helper. Neither bug affected substantive findings; coarse verdict bucket manually corrected to `OBSERVED_WSS_FAILED_REST_ALSO_STRUGGLED`.)

**What this closure ships.** Docs-only. `docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-b2-lte-recon1.md` §4 hypothesis matrix amended inline with per-hypothesis verdicts (bold-marked citations to §11). New §11 "Run 1 evidence closure" section (~80 lines) containing per-K1/K4/K6 evidence + main verdict + hypothesis-matrix delta + explicit "what this closure does NOT do" fence + fix-family pointers for a later architectural review. `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` new session-journal entry (this one). `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` new entry + backfill of previously-`#TBD` B2 mini-lock entry to `#365 7207593b`.

**What this closure does NOT do.**
- Not a fix-track scope-lock. Mini-lock §3 explicitly forbids that; §11 restates.
- Not a locator of the specific carrier / middlebox component. Simultaneous packet capture at both endpoints would be required, and that is beyond B2's remit.
- Not a change to `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 release / rollout gate. LTE rollout gate stays in force.
- Not a re-open of PR #330 (closed superseded 2026-07-04).
- Not an invalidation of B1's Wi-Fi closure (different network class, different failure surface).

**Next step (operator-locked).** Prepare a canonical prompt for an architectural review pass (Fable 5 / council) that receives Run 1 evidence + constraints and produces a ranked fix-family recommendation covering the whole Direct WSS realtime surface (text messages + voice notes + calls + delivery / ack + reconnect / route-change + push / fallback). The follow-on fix-track mini-lock opens only after (2) is on record. Prompt authorship in progress at `C:\temp\b2-k1-k4-recon-2026-07-04\fable5-fix-family-prompt.md`.

**Non-blocking follow-ups (unchanged).** `smoke-run.sh` delivery-invariant fix already landed 2026-07-04 (see `C:\temp\wi-fi-smoke-mc-pass-2026-07-01\INVARIANT-FIX-2026-07-04.md`). `§4.3 P3 regex hardening` still deferred from PR #360 Round 4 revert.

**In-force lineage.** L1 mini-lock + MB half (PR #353 `ed3406eb`) + MC-1 (PR #358 `91745acd`) + MC-2 (PR #359 `7bcf2d04`) + MC-3 (PR #360 `fd435c93`) + B1 closure (PR #361 `fe14c977`) + PR #364 (`bbf0cfff`) + B2 mini-lock (PR #365 `7207593b`) all in force. Methodology recon (PR #349 `54f2e50d`) stays Closed with verdict H-ME. `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 amendment (parent) unchanged.

**Verification.** No build change to verify. Docs-only. Voice + Cyrillic + future-date hygiene grep on diff clean.

### 2026-07-04 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-B2-LTE-RECON1 mini-lock opened + Track C (BodyTimeoutContractTest unquarantine) + Track A (PR #330 close-out)

**Goal.** Close the transport-track batch that opened after B1 landed on 2026-07-02: (a) unquarantine `BodyTimeoutContractTest` on `commonTest` after PR #360 MC-3 Round 6 quarantined it against a CI Ubuntu 30-minute-job hang, (b) administratively close PR #330 as superseded by MC-1/2/3 + PR #364, (c) open the B2 Tele2 LTE delivery-blocker recon mini-lock as the next facts-first product-track. Each of (a) / (b) / (c) is on its own scope; combining them here as one session-journal entry only for calendar-day durability.

**Outcome.** All three tracks landed cleanly. Master head advances `fe14c977 → bbf0cfff` via PR #364; PR #330 closed as superseded (no code delta); B2 mini-lock ships as docs-only on this PR head.

**Track C — BodyTimeoutContractTest unquarantine (PR #364 squash `bbf0cfff`).** Two-phase diagnostic before landing the fix:

- **Diagnostic phase 1 (PR #362, closed without merge).** Four CI Ubuntu runs on a probe branch (`diagnostic/body-timeout-hang-probe`) established via successively-closer-to-verbatim jvmTest probes (`v1` stripped; `v2` verbatim time-advance patterns + no `withTimeout` mask; `v3` no-DebugProbes control; `v4` verbatim `BodyTimeoutContractTest` fixture duplicate in `jvmTest`) that all four went CI green — meaning the hang is source-set sensitive (`commonTest` vs `jvmTest`). Then Option D (removed `@kotlin.test.Ignore` on the original `commonTest` class only, ZERO other change, head `d2ba8056`) triggered the 30-minute job timeout `08:31:16Z → 09:01:30Z` verbatim per the KDoc's historical Round 3-5 pattern, confirming the hang STILL fires on current master `fe14c977` post-MC-stack.
- **Diagnostic phase 2 (PR #363, closed without merge).** Option E `expect`/`actual` `HangDiagnostic` seam (`commonTest/HangDiagnostic.kt` + `jvmTest/HangDiagnostic.jvm.kt` (DebugProbes + wall-clock daemon watchdog) + `androidUnitTest/HangDiagnostic.android.kt` (no-op)) instrumented the un-quarantined `BodyTimeoutContractTest` cells on the diagnostic branch. CI head `5ff972f9` cancelled at the 30-minute timeout on `r12_body_timeout_after_headers_accounts_toward_breaker`, but with 54 watchdog fires captured 60-second stack + `DebugProbes.dumpCoroutines` snapshots to stderr. Findings: `coroutine#113` (`pollJob`) caught state `RUNNING` at `pollLoop:1568/1570` on every fire; `_breakerTimerJob` coroutines regenerated at ~6,400 launches / second real time (~11.5 million over the 30-min cancelled job); test worker thread `RUNNABLE` inside `TestCoroutineScheduler.advanceUntilIdleOr`. Dump archived durable at `C:/temp/body-timeout-hang-dump-2026-07-03/` (`pr363-full-ci.log` + `SUMMARY.md`).
- **Path 3 code read (static analysis on the dump).** `pollLoop` / `wsActivePollLoop` / `aliveTickLoop` all read `while (scope.isActive)` where `scope = CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + dispatcher)`. The `SupervisorJob()` has no parent, so `job.cancel()` on the individual poll job cancels the child only; the SupervisorJob itself stays `Active`. `scope.isActive` therefore stays `true` even when the current coroutine has been cancelled — the loops rely solely on `delay(...)` throwing `CancellationException` as their sole cancellation-exit path, which is a stale invariant regardless of the CI hang.
- **Path X production fix (PR #364 squash `bbf0cfff`).** Three-line change in `shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestFallbackOrchestrator.kt`: `while (scope.isActive)` → `while (currentCoroutineContext().isActive)` in `pollLoop:1539` + `aliveTickLoop:1854` + `wsActivePollLoop:1897`; add `import kotlinx.coroutines.currentCoroutineContext`. Extended comments at each site preserve the orphan-scope-Job explanation so a future reader does not revert to `scope.isActive` on cosmetic grounds. Class-level `@kotlin.test.Ignore` removed from `BodyTimeoutContractTest`; the historical Round 3-5 quarantine KDoc block preserved verbatim as evidence; a new "UNQUARANTINE ATTEMPT (2026-07-04) — Path X fix candidate" block appended below documenting the dump + root-cause identification. Local verification: `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest --tests BodyTimeoutContractTest` 6 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 0.29 s; full `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` 622 tests / 0 failures / 0 errors / 18 s. CI Ubuntu 4/4 SUCCESS on head `bd532934`. Merged. PR #362 + PR #363 closed without merge; diagnostic seam + `kotlinx-coroutines-debug` dep did NOT make it to master.

**Track A — PR #330 close-out (superseded).** RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 PR #330 (`canary/reconnect-quiescence` head `6f49cd89`, Draft since 2026-06-23) closed as superseded 2026-07-04. Byte-identity check vs current master `bbf0cfff`: `shared/core/transport/.../WsReconnectGate.kt` 0 lines diff, `shared/core/transport/.../WsReconnectGateTest.kt` 0 lines diff, `apps/android/.../TransportRewalkCoordinator.kt` 0 lines diff. `git diff master origin/canary/reconnect-quiescence --stat` reports 233 "canary-side" characters as effectively (i) older comment provenance labels (e.g. "commit 2e fix-round-1 (2026-06-22)" that master's squash-merge rewrote to reference MC-1/2/3 provenance) and (ii) canary being behind master on subsequent work (PR #353 L1 mini-lock, Sprint 2b-A/B/C, PR #364). No functional code unique to canary. Closing comment fixation includes: MC-1 (PR #358 `91745acd`) + MC-2 (PR #359 `7bcf2d04`) + MC-3 (PR #360 `fd435c93`) + B1 closure (PR #361 `fe14c977`) + PR #364 `bbf0cfff` map where each part of PR #330's original scope landed; **explicit LTE rollout gate note** (Wi-Fi B1 PASS does NOT unblock LTE per parent recon §11 amendment; RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 code shipping to LTE users still requires either (i) B2 track closes with a fix that resolves the Tele2 LTE long-connection surface, or (ii) an alternative transport lands separately — neither path is on this branch's remit); **release-flag posture unchanged** (`RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED`, `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED`, `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` all stay literal `"0"` in the release block; production rollout to Wi-Fi users happens through a separate flag-flip PR, not by this closure).

**Track B — DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-B2-LTE-RECON1 mini-lock (this PR, docs-only).** Materialises the B2 forward-pointer from `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 (2026-06-28 amendment). Track-doc at `docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-b2-lte-recon1.md` (10 sections). Scope: Tele2 LTE real-device delivery reliability. Hypotheses split into two orthogonal levels — **causal** (H-B2-Carrier-NAT-Idle / H-B2-Byte-Freeze / H-B2-Age-Kill / H-B2-Doze-OEM / H-B2-Config-Mismatch) and **fault-scope** (H-B2-REST-Survives-WSS-Fails / H-B2-REST-LongPoll-Separate-Fault / H-B2-Both-Fail). Seven diagnostic instruments B2-K1 through B2-K7 explicitly NOT pre-committed beyond the "B2-K1 + B2-K4 first" §7 requirement. Six acceptance gates PASS-A (idle-time threshold + keep-alive fix candidate) / PASS-B (byte-or-age threshold + rotation candidate) / PASS-C (Doze / OEM cause + Android-side mitigation candidate) / PASS-D (REST survives while WSS fails + faster fall-back strategy candidate) / FAIL-Wider-Issue (both fail; requires alternative transport OR relay hold-policy change) / PARK (2 clean B2-K1 attempts with no reproduction, redirects to next-network-class candidacy). First deliverable = **B2-K1 + B2-K4** on one Tele2 LTE real-device session after mini-lock merges. Operator-run smoke template is a follow-on artefact NOT shipped by this PR. Facts-first per WORKING_RULES rule 3.

**In-force lineage.** Methodology recon (PR #349 `54f2e50d`) stays Closed with verdict H-ME. `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 amendment + §13 B1 CLOSED verdict in force. `TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1` §11 closure carry-forward. `rc-direct-stability1.md` § 13 (Direct WSS Mode 2 root-cause park at Arm G v10/v11 write-stall) carry-forward.

**Non-blocking follow-ups (opened separately, not by this PR):** smoke script delivery invariant fix (script `smoke-run.sh` currently only counts `REST_TRACE inbound_deliver`, missed WS-path deliveries in B1 run 2 and produced false-positive `FAIL`) / §4.3 P3 regex hardening deferred from PR #360 Round 4 revert.

### 2026-07-02 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §13 B1 acceptance gate CLOSED via controlled Wi-Fi smoke PASS

**Goal.** Close the B1 acceptance gate opened by `docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 by exercising all three §7 sub-gates: **MC PASS** + **MB PASS** + **Wi-Fi smoke PASS**. Prior to today, MC PASS (PR #360 squash `fd435c93`, MC stack part 3 of 3) and MB PASS (PR #353 `ed3406eb`, L1 synthetic-trigger `DebugForceMode2Activity`) were both on record. The remaining gate was a controlled Wi-Fi smoke that exercises the full quiescence chain end-to-end in the field.

**Outcome.** All three §7 sub-gates now cleared. **B1 CLOSED on run 2**.

**Fix-candidate APK.** Built from master `fd435c93` (MC-3 merged head) with four flags forced to `"1"` via `-P` gradle properties on the release-flavor `assembleRelease` task: `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` + `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` + `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` + `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION`. Sideloaded to Tecno BF7-12 (`adb serial <redacted-device-serial>`) + emu pair. APK size 202 MB, `sha256: 5d3de3790b999f957e667d63dcf93539ecbb0015867de7ef3703b2161ade304e`. Build was the docs author's responsibility, not the operator's.

**Wi-Fi smoke — run 2 (PASS).** After full state reset on both devices (`pm clear phantom.android` + fresh onboarding + pairing) to clean any prior crypto-store contamination, the smoke exercised the complete quiescence chain via synthetic Mode 2 trigger. Marker chronology on Tecno wall clock (13 ordered log lines: 8 required quiescence-chain markers per §7 acceptance + 2 `ws_reconnect_quiesced` occurrences from the initial arm and the `route_change_invalidates_probe` re-quiesce + 3 `mode_switched` context lines showing the state transitions the chain drives):

```

Counters: 1× `sticky_armed`, 2 unique `route_epoch` × 1 grant each (`route_change_invalidates_probe` invariant correct on multi-step Wi-Fi flap), probation `elapsed_ms_since_arm=78008` inside the `[60000..90000]` window.

**Delivery — PASS both directions (via WS path).** Emu → Tecno (`7b1733ad`) exercised the Sprint 2b-C bootstrap-repair path: `bootstrap_path reason=responder_role_redirected` → `prekey_fetch_result=200` → `ratchet_encrypt_ok bootstrap=true` → `sealed_sender_pack_ok` → `relay_send_return ok=true` → `Ack status=delivered`. On the Tecno receiver: `DECRYPT_TRACE attempt sessionExists=true x3dhInitPresent=true` → `DECRYPT_TRACE pending_fallback_fail reason=mac_fail_under_pending` → `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_armed reason=fail_mac_existing_session` → `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_ok bootstrap=true plaintextBytes=60 elapsedMs=197 promotion=true`. Message inserted into DB and `handleDeliver DONE ack-deliver sent`. Tecno → Emu mirror (`f290bfb1`) fired the same `inbound_repair_ok promotion=true` shape on the emu side. Follow-up Emu → Tecno (`6960ac2a`) after session promotion took the direct decrypt path: `DECRYPT_TRACE ok elapsedMs=7 bootstrap=false`. 3 messages delivered end-to-end. `relay_send_return ok=false` count = 0.

**Phase B hypothesis matrix (`docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11).** 6 PASS / 0 NOT EXERCISED / 0 FAIL:

| Hypothesis | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| H-330-Quiesces-Storm | PASS | Synthetic Mode 2 → sticky → quiesced immediately |
| H-330-Preserves-REST | PASS | REST flowed during Quiesced window; 0 delivery errors |
| H-330-Single-Probe-Per-RouteChange | PASS | 2 unique `route_epoch` × 1 probe each; `route_change_invalidates_probe` on multi-step flap |
| H-330-Probe-Lives-60s | PASS | `elapsed_ms_since_arm=78008` in window |
| H-330-No-Self-Reentry | PASS | Candidate did not autonomously spawn between epochs |
| H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups | PASS | 0 `relay_send_return ok=false`; 3 messages delivered |

§11 met **in letter AND spirit** (previous K-6 verdict on 2026-06-28 was NON-REGRESSION-only since natural Wi-Fi did not reproduce Mode 2; today's run used the synthetic trigger via `DebugForceMode2Activity` — path (b) of §12 forward-pointer — closing the methodology gap via `QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1` PR #349 verdict H-ME + MB PR #353 + the MC-1/2/3 stack).

**Wi-Fi smoke — run 1 (contaminated crypto state side-finding, NOT a B1 blocker).** An earlier run 1 attempt showed the quiescence mechanism PASS but delivery FAIL. Root cause: `sessionExists=true` + `x3dhInitPresent=false` + `fail_mac action=hold` receiver-side state inconsistency from prior test-cycle contamination (the first `fail_mac` fired 11 seconds BEFORE the synthetic trigger, so predates PR #330 territory). Sprint 2b-C repair markers hit 0. Under operator's rule "don't spawn a new track until we know reproducible bug vs contamination," run 2 was executed after `pm clear` on both devices + fresh onboarding. Run 2's signal matrix showed `x3dhInitPresent=true` throughout and Sprint 2b-C `inbound_repair_ok promotion=true` firing 3 times — root cause is contamination-only, refuted as a reproducible blocker. `RECV-SESSION-X3DH-INIT-STATE-RECON1` mini-lock **NOT opened**. Opens only if `x3dhInitPresent=false + fail_mac hold` reproduces after a clean `pm clear + fresh onboarding` in the future.

**Closure verdict (formulation preserved).**

```
B1 CLOSED on run 2.
Run 1 = contaminated crypto state side-finding, not B1 blocker.
Script FAIL in run 2 = false-positive due to REST-only delivery invariant.
```

**What this PR ships.** `docs/tracks/direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §13 amendment (B1 CLOSED verdict + 6-hypothesis matrix + run 2 evidence + run 1 side-finding preserved + non-blocking follow-ups listed) + this session-journal entry + `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` entry.

**What this PR does NOT change.** No code change. B2 remains unopened. Release-rollout gate stays in force (PR #330 does NOT ship to LTE users on Wi-Fi B1-PASS alone per §11). PR #330 Draft / HOLD status untouched (head `6f49cd89`); the RC PR advances per its own mini-lock contract now that B1 is closed.

**Non-blocking follow-ups (separate PRs, not this closure).**

1. `BodyTimeoutContractTest` unquarantine — reproduce hang in Linux Docker → fix dispatcher-mix in fixture → remove class-level `@Ignore` added in PR #360 Round 6.
2. Smoke script delivery invariant fix — script `smoke-run.sh` currently only counts `REST_TRACE inbound_deliver` and missed run 2's WS-path deliveries, producing false-positive `FAIL`. Extend to also accept `handleDeliver DONE` / `Inserting message into DB` / `DECRYPT_TRACE ok` / `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_ok` as delivery signals.
3. §4.3 P3 regex hardening — extend reversed-comparison pattern to catch receiver-prefixed `"synthetic" == event.closeOrigin` shape (deferred from PR #360 Round 4 revert).

**Verification.** No build change to verify. Docs-only. Voice + Cyrillic + future-date hygiene grep on this PR's diff clean.

  - `H-330-No-Self-Reentry` — closed by `WsReconnectGateTest` candidate-death cells `CandidateProving → Quiesced` (MC-1)
- **§6 PARTIAL hypotheses (SHOULD-reinforce):** all three REINFORCED via layered coverage:
  - `H-330-Preserves-REST` — reinforced by `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest` ctor-forwarding cells (MC-3, 3 cells: Direct-fence engagement + null-safe skip + token forwarding) + NEW `GateQuiescenceRestPreservationReinforcementTest` state-machine cell (MC-3, 1 cell, ~65 LOC) pinning that `RestActive` state survives duplicate `WsSessionEnded` events across the Quiesced window
  - `H-330-Probe-Lives-60s` — reinforced by `WsReconnectGateTest` `WsAliveTickElapsed` cells (MC-1, 4 uses covering the 60s probation gate transition)
  - `H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups` — reinforced by `KtorRelayTransportPendingOutboundTest` (MC-2, byte-replaced with PR #330 version, +238 net covering gate-coordinated pending-outbound FIFO across transitions)
- **§4.2 sequential dispatcher order structural test (L-13.3.3):** NEW `WsSessionLifecycleDispatcherSequentialOrderTest` (MC-3, 3 cells covering Ended-REST-active branch / Ended-REST-inactive-bootstrap-retry branch / Connected single-consumer shape) — PASS.
- **§4.3 `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` non-branching grep test (L-13.3.4):** NEW `CloseOriginSyntheticNonBranchingGrepTest` (MC-3, 1 cell walking source under `shared/core/transport/src/commonMain`, `shared/core/transport/src/androidMain`, `apps/android/src/androidMain`, `apps/android/src/debug` for `if (...closeOrigin == "synthetic"...)` / `when (closeOrigin)` / `closeOrigin.equals("synthetic")` patterns; assignment-side `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` in the L1 producer allowed via explicit assignment-only allow-list) — PASS with zero violations.
- **§4.4 `maybeRetryBootstrap()` disposition (L-13.3.5):** EXPLICIT DEFERRAL — bootstrap-alt-path is a narrow recovery alternative that the L1 mini-lock §5.1 already fences (synthetic refuses when `restCapabilityActive == false`); MC does NOT add a dedicated cell for the bootstrap-arm gate posture because the L1 fence + the §4.2 branch coverage already assert the correct dispatcher-side dispatch of the bootstrap path.
- **§4.5 acceptance matrix (L-13.3.11):** included via `WsReconnectGateTest` (MC-1) which is byte-identical with PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` source (`sha256: 3780d1ca1c73f4d6bfa2251cae6852b5146c0776f4a805daa37adfbd16707acc`).

Therefore **MC PASS** per §7. Combined with the already-landed MB PASS (PR #353 squash `ed3406eb`), the two H-ME validation halves are satisfied and the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run UNLOCKS as a separate operator-scheduled item. **B1 acceptance gate from `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 closes only after Wi-Fi smoke PASS** — MC PASS + MB PASS on their own do NOT close B1 per the mini-lock §7 wording amendment.

**What MC-3 ships:**

- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/TransportRewalkCoordinator.kt`** — cherry-picked verbatim from PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` (`sha256: 5b0cc9185b928b6c01bac6cc0a285a6c65699a6ad5ad3f15b654963181ee3308`), master 319 LOC → 592 LOC (+321/-48, net +273). Implements 7-step gate transaction (`beginRouteChange` → branch on `RouteChangeOutcome.OpenReconnect / StickyRecovery / QuiescencePreserved` → `disconnectAndJoin(10_000ms)` → `releaseTransport` → `issueProbeAfterRewalk` → `requestServiceRestart`) with `NonCancellable` revoke discipline at every substep. New `internal interface RewalkHybridFacade` with 3 methods (`submitNetworkChangedEvent` / `disconnect` / `disconnectAndJoin`). `gateCoordinator: RewalkCoordinatorGateProvider?` nullable ctor param — when null, coordinator falls back to legacy pre-quiescence sequence.
- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/di/AppContainer.kt`** (+142/-8) — cherry-picked from PR #330 preserving PR #353 `triggerDebugForceMode2` block (~85 LOC restored verbatim) + PR #353 `debugForceMode2Enabled` ctor-arg wiring on the `wsTransport = KtorRelayTransport(...)` call. Adds `sharedCurrentKindProvider` single-source-of-truth lambda (shared with `HybridRelayTransport`), `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` BuildConfig direct read (no `BuildConfig.DEBUG` conjunction — release-pin is the rollout knob), late-binding `wsTransport.gateProvider = restOrchestrator.stateMachine` after `initMessaging`, `gateCoordinator = restOrchestrator.stateMachine` wired into `TransportRewalkCoordinator`. `runCatching { startService() }` swallow removed — treats `startService() == null` as `IllegalStateException` so rewalk coordinator's revoke path fires.
- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher.kt`** (+3/-1) — cherry-picked from PR #330. Carries `connectionGeneration = event.connectionGeneration` into `RestStateMachine.Event.WsSessionConnected(...)` ctor call.
- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestFallbackOrchestrator.kt`** (+40/-6) — cherry-picked from PR #330. Three new ctor params (`reconnectQuiescenceEnabled: Boolean = false` / `currentKindProvider: () -> TransportKind? = { null }` / `tokenSource: () -> Long = { 0L }`) with KDoc; all three forwarded to `RestStateMachine` ctor. Defaults preserve legacy semantics (gate never engages when quiescence is off).
- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/HybridRelayTransport.kt`** (+27/-2) — MC-3 layered add: `class HybridRelayTransport : RelayTransport, RewalkHybridFacade` (new interface impl), `override` modifier on `submitNetworkChangedEvent` (interface member), plus PR #330 test seams `setRestCapabilityActiveForTest` + `awaitMigrationDoneForTest` (Integration Test 20 requirement).
- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt`** (184 LOC new) — byte-identical with PR #330 (`sha256: 2dbdc44ce1b753dcd678a4dc8e568f3d9b30f22e848a5d659ba4f15927f27460`). 3 cells covering orchestrator → state-machine ctor wiring for `currentKindProvider` + `tokenSource`.
- **`apps/android/src/androidUnitTest/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/TransportRewalkCoordinatorTransactionTest.kt`** (667 LOC new) — byte-identical with PR #330 (`sha256: fec689c789bf8b96c17e9807b6ba50ab588e8ad24bd47f598631626112ec6aac`). Coordinator 7-step transaction cells.
- **`apps/android/src/androidUnitTest/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/HybridRelayTransportIntegrationTest20.kt`** (686 LOC new) — byte-identical (`sha256: 9b7e4791a27320c818b0997d3a78d97ff543f1fd8defd85db3528be4205c3366`). Higher-level hybrid integration.
- **`apps/android/src/androidUnitTest/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/WsSessionLifecycleDispatcherSequentialOrderTest.kt`** (MC-3 authored ~150 LOC) — 3 cells pinning §4.2 sequential-order contract.
- **`shared/core/transport/src/jvmTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/CloseOriginSyntheticNonBranchingGrepTest.kt`** (MC-3 authored ~140 LOC) — 1 cell walking source tree for `if/when` branches on `closeOrigin == "synthetic"`; assignment-side `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` in the L1 producer allowed via explicit allow-list.
- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/GateQuiescenceRestPreservationReinforcementTest.kt`** (MC-3 authored ~90 LOC) — 1 cell asserting `RestActive` state survives duplicate `WsSessionEnded` events + stray `WsAliveTickElapsed` under `reconnectQuiescenceEnabled = true` + Direct fence.

**Verification PASSED locally:**

- `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` BUILD SUCCESSFUL (includes all new MC-3 tests + all PR #330 tests + all PR #353 L1 cells).
- `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest` BUILD SUCCESSFUL (includes `AppContainerDebugForceMode2WiringTest` PR #353 cells after `debugForceMode2Enabled` wiring restored on the `wsTransport = KtorRelayTransport(...)` call — L1 wiring test caught the initial cherry-pick omission).
- `:apps:android:assembleRelease` BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `:apps:android:verifyR8StripsTestSeams PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* classes or members survived on any phantom.* class.` (All L1 + MC-1/MC-2/MC-3 test seams stripped from release by existing deny-pattern discipline.)

**Cherry-pick discipline (PR #353 + PR #357 + PR #358 + PR #359 surface preservation):**

`AppContainer.kt` PR #330 cherry-pick would have naïvely deleted:

- PR #353's `triggerDebugForceMode2` KDoc + method (~85 LOC restored)
- PR #353's `debugForceMode2Enabled` ctor-arg wiring on `wsTransport = KtorRelayTransport(...)` — the L1 wiring test `AppContainerDebugForceMode2WiringTest` caught this: initial cherry-pick failed the test; restoring the wiring pattern fixed both cells

`HybridRelayTransport.kt` layered surface restored:

- MC-2's `override suspend fun disconnectAndJoin` — unchanged
- New `RewalkHybridFacade` impl (MC-3 addition — 3 interface members already existed as `suspend fun submitNetworkChangedEvent` / `disconnect` / `disconnectAndJoin`; just add `RewalkHybridFacade` to the class header + `override` modifier on `submitNetworkChangedEvent`)
- New `setRestCapabilityActiveForTest` + `awaitMigrationDoneForTest` seams (Integration Test 20 requirement)

RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. Methodology recon stays Closed with verdict H-ME unchanged. L1 mini-lock + MB half (PR #353 `ed3406eb`) + path-2 step 2 narrowing (PR #352 `a28bb1d2`) + Strategy 1 lock (PR #355 `ca12a98c`) + §13.1 test-scope correction (PR #356 `d64bef0a`) + gate-only carve-out (PR #357 `daee9645`) + MC-1 (PR #358 `91745acd`) + MC-2 (PR #359 `7bcf2d04`) all in force.

**Follow-up after MC-3 merges:** controlled Wi-Fi smoke run opens as a separate operator-scheduled item. After Wi-Fi smoke PASS, B1 acceptance gate from `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 closes. PR #330 then advances per its own mini-lock contract.

**Key commits:** TBD (squash SHA backfilled on merge).

### 2026-07-01 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK MC-2 — Ktor permit flow + RelayTransport.disconnectAndJoin fan-out + NonCancellable cleanupCap=8 discipline (MC stack part 2 of 3)

**Outcome:** Second of the three-PR MC stack per §13.2 step 3. Stacked on PR #358 squash `91745acd` (MC-1). Lands the `KtorRelayTransport` reconnect-loop permit-flow consumer of the two provider interfaces already delivered by MC-1, plus the new `suspend fun disconnectAndJoin(timeoutMs)` interface method with `NonCancellable` critical region + `cleanupCap = 8` bounded cleanup scope, plus the four PR #330 `KtorRelayTransport`-side test files. **MC PASS is NOT declared by this PR alone** — the MC PASS ledger lands on MC-3 after §4.2 + §4.3 + §4.4 disposition + §4.5 floor + reinforcement cells per §7.

**What MC-2 ships:**

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/KtorRelayTransport.kt`** (+1024 / -116) — cherry-picked from PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` preserving PR #353 L1 surface. New: `initialGateProvider: WsReconnectGateProvider? = null` ctor param + `@Volatile var gateProvider` for late-binding by AppContainer in MC-3; `runReconnectLoop` consumes `awaitReconnectPermit` / `validatePermitAfterAuth` / `recordProbeAttemptFailed` (`OpenPermit` → normal reconnect, `ClaimedProbe` → recovery, `LoopRetired` → break); per-loop `ownerGeneration` allocated via `gateProvider.allocateConnectionGeneration()`; `WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Connected` extended with `connectionGeneration: Long = 0L` (intrinsic — Lifecycle events live inline in this file); `disconnectAndJoin(timeoutMs: Long): Boolean` override with `NonCancellable` critical region cancelling reconnect job + queueing session/client cleanup to `cleanupScope` (Dispatchers.IO + SupervisorJob); `cleanupCap = 8` slots refuse further work on exhaustion (WARN log, ref abandoned) — this is a load-bearing constant documented in-source, the bound is required because blocking `close()` calls cannot be interrupted by cooperative cancellation and the alternative is unbounded off-scope leakage. PR #353 surface fully preserved verbatim: `debugForceMode2Enabled` ctor param + `debugForceMode2Synthetic` method + `currentSessionEpoch` accessor + `oneShotLatchConsumedAtEpoch` field + `oneShotLatchMutex` + 3 `*ForTest*` seams (`setStateForTest` / `bumpSessionEpochForTest` / `resetOneShotLatchForTest`).

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RelayTransport.kt`** (+65) — new `suspend fun disconnectAndJoin(timeoutMs: Long = 10_000L): Boolean` interface member with `NonCancellable`-critical-region + bounded-join contract documented in the KDoc.

- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/HybridRelayTransport.kt`** (+17) — pass-through override delegating to `wsTransport.disconnectAndJoin(timeoutMs)`. No REST-side teardown of its own; the inner `KtorRelayTransport` owns the reconnect loop and cleanup discipline.

- **Fan-out stubs** for the 3 inline test `RelayTransport` impls (all `= true` since test doubles have no real reconnect job to wait on): `shared/core/transport/.../FakeRelayTransportTest.kt.FakeRelayTransport` (+2), `shared/core/messaging/.../Alpha0IntegrationTest.kt.BufferingRelayTransport` (+2), `shared/core/messaging/.../DefaultMessagingServiceTest.kt.FakeRelayTransport` + `.ManualIncomingTransport` (+4 total across two classes).

- **`apps/android/build.gradle.kts`** (+11) — `implementation(kotlin("reflect"))` added to `androidUnitTest` source set. Required by the new `KtorRelayTransportInternalTestSeams.kt` which reaches `shared:core:transport` `internal` seams via `kotlin.reflect.full.callSuspend`. Reflection stays confined to `androidUnitTest` (excluded from any APK); seams stay `internal` (not widened to Kotlin source-level API).

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/KtorRelayTransportRunReconnectLoopTest.kt`** (480 LOC new) — byte-identical with PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` source, `sha256: 55035841473049d4e89f1e686147737c370d782bb8486da8cd5dd1d3390c6931`.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/KtorRelayTransportDisconnectAndJoinTest.kt`** (848 LOC new) — byte-identical, `sha256: 3e1e6b6abd56ee8491fc0d5b024b1129a746f28920a40451dc67a70eeea36439`.

- **`apps/android/src/androidUnitTest/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/KtorRelayTransportInternalTestSeams.kt`** (153 LOC new) — byte-identical, `sha256: de8cb66596b20a78e72e0cd01ab0ef1c199f0d8e8d8d55f9511fc0d62738c28c`. Reflection bridge for `androidUnitTest` callers to reach `internal` seams on `KtorRelayTransport` (`closeForTest`, `cleanupInflightForTest`) that live in the sibling `shared:core:transport` module.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/KtorRelayTransportPendingOutboundTest.kt`** — byte-replaced with PR #330 version (+238 net, 426 → 662 LOC, `sha256: 9157a67bf1b382857a5cf09ac73e54219222efa39bbc61fd1aa4f6799ebff0e7`).

**Verification PASSED locally:**

- `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` PASS ×3 iterations at ~40s each after single-file isolated baselines (BodyTimeoutContractTest 34s / RunReconnectLoopTest 38s / DisconnectAndJoinTest 34s / PendingOutboundTest 37s).
- `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest` PASS.
- `:apps:android:assembleRelease` PASS.
- `:apps:android:verifyR8StripsTestSeams PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* classes or members survived on any phantom.* class.` All PR #353 L1 seams + all new MC-2 `*ForTest` seams stripped from release by existing deny-pattern discipline.

**Transient hang note:** the first background `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` on MC-2 head hung 24 minutes with 0-byte output before being killed with `taskkill`. NOT reproducible after killing — 8/8 subsequent runs PASS at ~40s each; production code alone (baseline `BodyTimeoutContractTest`) passes on MC-2 HEAD. Suspected transient Gradle daemon / JVM lock state during in-flight file edits, no code fix issued for it. If it recurs on CI it will be treated the same way as the PR #358 24-minute cancel: single rerun on the same head; only a second recurrence would escalate to fix-round on `KtorRelayTransport` teardown / dangling coroutine cleanup.

**What MC-2 does NOT ship (defers to MC-3):**

- No `TransportRewalkCoordinator` 7-step gate transaction (`beginRouteChange` → branch → `disconnectAndJoin` → release → `issueProbeAfterRewalk` → `requestServiceRestart`).
- No `AppContainer` BuildConfig wiring or late-binding `gateProvider` assignment.
- No `WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher.connectionGeneration` field-carry.
- No `RestFallbackOrchestrator` new ctor params for `currentKindProvider` + `tokenSource`.
- No `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest`.
- No fresh §4.2 sequential-dispatcher-order test.
- No fresh §4.3 `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` non-branching grep test.
- No §4.4 `maybeRetryBootstrap()` disposition note.
- No reinforcement cells for H-330-Preserves-REST + H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups.
- No MC PASS ledger.
- No Wi-Fi smoke opening.

**Follow-up:** MC-3 opens AFTER this PR merges, stacked on MC-2's squash. MC PASS ledger + Wi-Fi smoke open only after MC-3 lands.

**Key commits:** TBD (squash SHA backfilled in MASTER_TIMELINE on merge).

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK MC-1 — RestStateMachine gate state-transition logic + provider implementations + WsReconnectGateTest integration suite (MC stack part 1 of 3)

**Outcome:** First of the three-PR MC stack opened against §13.2 step 3 of the MC half mini-lock. Lands the `WsReconnectGate` state-transition logic on `RestStateMachine` + the two provider implementations (`WsReconnectGateProvider` / `RewalkCoordinatorGateProvider`) + the PR #330 1172-LOC integration test `WsReconnectGateTest.kt`. Stacked on PR #357 squash `daee9645` (gate-only carve-out). **MC PASS verdict is NOT declared by this PR alone** — only after MC-3 lands the full stack does MC PASS get on record per §7 of the mini-lock; the operator-greenlit stack discipline pins this explicitly in every PR body.

**Three-PR MC stack shape (operator-locked):**

- **MC-1 (this PR):** RestStateMachine core + provider implementations + WsReconnectGateTest + unavoidable suspend ripple through `RestFallbackOrchestrator.submitEvent`.
- **MC-2:** RelayTransport interface fan-out (`suspend fun disconnectAndJoin`) + KtorRelayTransport permit flow + NonCancellable + `cleanupCap = 8` cleanupScope + the four PR #330 KtorRelayTransport tests (DisconnectAndJoinTest, RunReconnectLoopTest, PendingOutboundTest modifications, InternalTestSeams).
- **MC-3:** TransportRewalkCoordinator + AppContainer + HybridRelayTransport + WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher wiring + fresh §4.2 sequential-dispatcher-order test + fresh §4.3 `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` non-branching grep test + §4.4 `maybeRetryBootstrap()` explicit deferral note + reinforcement cells for H-330-Preserves-REST + H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups + final MC PASS ledger.

**What MC-1 ships:**

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestStateMachine.kt`** (+1004/-77, net +927, 902 → 1829 LOC) — cherry-picked from PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` source onto master. Brought: 3 new ctor params (`reconnectQuiescenceEnabled: Boolean = false`, `currentKindProvider: () -> TransportKind? = { null }`, `tokenSource: () -> Long = { 0L }`) with build-time invariant `reconnectQuiescenceEnabled ⇒ mode2StickyEnabled`; new private state (`_gate: MutableStateFlow<WsReconnectGate>`, `routeEpoch`, `connectionGenerationCounter`, `gateLock: Mutex`, `probeAttemptCount`); two provider implementations covering 11 gate API methods total (`gate / allocateConnectionGeneration / awaitReconnectPermit / validatePermitAfterAuth / recordProbeAttemptFailed` from `WsReconnectGateProvider`; `beginRouteChange / revokeRouteChange / issueProbeAfterRewalk / revokeProbe` from `RewalkCoordinatorGateProvider`; plus `awaitAndClaimProbe / currentRouteEpoch / currentConnectionGenerationCounter`); 2 internal test seams (`setResidualProbeStateForTest` + `probeAttemptCountForTest`); all `onEvent(...)` arms become `suspend` for `gateLock.withLock { }`; new `armSticky()` Direct-only fence; refactored `transitionToWsActive()` with sealed `ProofOutcome` (Committed / Rejected / NotApplicable). PR #353 surface explicitly **preserved** (cherry-pick discipline, NOT copy-paste): the `@Volatile` markers on `stickyRecovery` + `mode2StickyRestActive` AND the public `val isStickyOrRecoveryActive: Boolean` accessor stay on the file with KDoc explaining how they coexist with the new `gateLock` discipline (defence-in-depth for the lockless cross-thread reader path the L1 synthetic-trigger surface relies on via `AppContainer.triggerDebugForceMode2`).

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestFallbackOrchestrator.kt`** (+11, -2) — `fun submitEvent(...)` becomes `suspend fun submitEvent(...)`. Unavoidable mechanical signature change since `RestStateMachine.onEvent` is now `suspend`. KDoc explains the ripple is plumbing, NOT quiescence runtime activation. The 4 other production call-sites of `stateMachine.onEvent` inside `RestFallbackOrchestrator` (`aliveTickLoop`, `recordRestFailure`, `handle410`, `forceBreakerTripForS6TestTrigger`) are already inside `suspend fun` methods on master and compile without change.

- **`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/HybridRelayTransport.kt`** — 2 production call-sites of `orchestrator.submitEvent(...)` (lines 767 + 812) verified already inside `suspend fun` methods (`submitStateEvent` + `submitStateEvents`) on master. NO file change required.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/WsReconnectGateTest.kt`** (1172 LOC new) — byte-identical with PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` source (git-blob SHA `3780d1ca1c73f4d6bfa2251cae6852b5146c0776f4a805daa37adfbd16707acc`). 34 test cells across 15 domains: Direct-only fence / probe atomicity & currency / route-epoch staleness / token type-level absence / state-transition paths / budget exhaustion (attempt + wall-clock) / permit lifecycle / revocation idempotency / ABA cycle / gate-bypass protection / failure-path recovery / stale tick rejection / full lifecycle / budget reset / token redaction. Zero production classes from outside `phantom.core.transport.*` instantiated.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestStateMachineTestHelpers.kt`** (31 LOC new) — byte-identical with PR #330 source. Defines two `internal fun` extensions (`RestStateMachine.onEventNow(event)` + `RestFallbackOrchestrator.submitEventNow(event)`) that wrap `runBlocking { onEvent(event) }` for non-coroutine `@Test` methods. The convention pinned in the helper KDoc: tests already inside `runTest` / `runBlocking` call `.onEvent(...)` directly; pre-2026-06-22 plain `@Test` cells call `.onEventNow(...)`.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestStateMachineTest.kt`** — bulk replace `sm.onEvent(` → `sm.onEventNow(` (143 sites). No semantic change; the helper preserves call semantics via `runBlocking`.

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/RestFallbackOrchestratorPollLoopTest.kt`** (1 line) — `orch.submitEvent(` → `orch.submitEventNow(` in the `driveStateToRestActive` helper (only call-site of `submitEvent` outside a `runTest` block in the existing tests).

- **`shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/KtorRelayTransportDebugForceMode2Test.kt`** (3 sites) — `machine.onEvent(` → `machine.onEventNow(` in the round-2 D-1 dedup test cell `rest_state_machine_silently_absorbs_duplicate_ended_for_same_epoch`. PR #353 L1 surface contract preserved.

**Verification PASSED locally:**

- `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL (includes new `WsReconnectGateTest` 34 cells + async-refactored `RestStateMachineTest` + all PR #353 L1 cells still PASS via `onEventNow` helper).
- `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `:apps:android:assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `:apps:android:verifyR8StripsTestSeams` — `PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* classes or members survived on any phantom.* class.` MC-1 adds two new `*ForTest` seams on `RestStateMachine` (`setResidualProbeStateForTest`, `probeAttemptCountForTest`) — the existing deny-pattern discipline strips both from release.

**What MC-1 does NOT ship (defers to MC-2 / MC-3):**

- No `KtorRelayTransport` `runReconnectLoop` permit-flow refactor. No `disconnectAndJoin` method. No NonCancellable cleanupScope. No `RelayTransport` interface fan-out. (→ MC-2.)
- No `TransportRewalkCoordinator` gate-transaction logic. No `AppContainer` BuildConfig wiring or late-binding of `gateProvider`. No `HybridRelayTransport` `disconnectAndJoin` pass-through. No `WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher` `connectionGeneration` field on `WsSessionConnected`. (→ MC-3.)
- No fresh §4.2 sequential-dispatcher-order test. No fresh §4.3 `closeOrigin = "synthetic"` non-branching grep test. No §4.4 `maybeRetryBootstrap()` disposition note. No reinforcement cells for H-330-Preserves-REST + H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups. (→ MC-3.)
- No MC PASS ledger. MC-1 alone does NOT close §6 — only the full three-PR stack does.

**Cherry-pick discipline (PR #353 + PR #357 surface preservation):**

PR #330 was forked before PR #353 (MB half) merged. Naïve copy-paste of PR #330's RestStateMachine would have deleted PR #353's L1 surface. Cherry-pick approach preserved on master:

- `RestStateMachine.isStickyOrRecoveryActive: Boolean` accessor — restored verbatim with extended KDoc explaining the coexistence with `gateLock`.
- `@Volatile` on `stickyRecovery` and `mode2StickyRestActive` — restored with KDoc updated to describe gate-coexistence semantics.
- `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION` + `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` flags — both stay (PR #353 + PR #357 contracts).
- L1 release-pin tests + S6 manifest contract test + DebugForceMode2 wiring test + L1 synthetic-trigger Kotlin sources — all stay; no touch.
- Carve-out `WsReconnectGate.kt` + `WsReconnectGateStructuralTest.kt` + `ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest.kt` (PR #357) — all stay; this PR layers MC-1 on top.

**Follow-up:** MC-2 opens AFTER this PR merges, stacked on MC-1's squash. MC-3 opens AFTER MC-2 merges, stacked on MC-2's squash. MC PASS ledger is the final paragraph of MC-3's body; only then can the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run open as a separate operator-scheduled item.

**Key commits:** TBD (squash SHA backfilled on merge).

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK gate-only carve-out from PR #330 (RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 gate-component shipped to master ahead of MC implementation PR)

**Outcome:** First gate-only carve-out PR opens against the §13.1 corrected wording (PR #356 squash `d64bef0a`) implementing the §13.4 hand-off contract. Brings the `phantom.core.transport.WsReconnectGate` type-and-interface surface from PR #330 commit `6f49cd89` to master verbatim — `sha256: 64e2d106366e3f737fb287cba170ba5de36854564937da8e16a706094c97b172` byte-identical with the PR #330 source — plus a fresh 508-LOC structural test file (`WsReconnectGateStructuralTest.kt`, 27 cells) covering the gate file's actual surface in pure isolation per §13.1's corrected test-scope wording, plus the `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` BuildConfig flag (release-pinned `"0"` per the existing `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` / `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` / `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION` idiom), plus a 3-cell companion release-pin test (`ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest`). NO orchestrator wiring stubs (the gate file imposes no compile-time dependency on any existing class per the §13.1 round-2 conditional rule). NO ProGuard discipline extension (the gate file introduces no new `KtorRelayTransport` members). NO `RestStateMachine` modifications. NO `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` (PR #330's 1172-LOC integration suite) and NO `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt` — both integration-scoped per §13.5 and deferred to the MC implementation PR.

**Structural test surface (`WsReconnectGateStructuralTest.kt`):**

- Sealed-class distinctness for the 5 `WsReconnectGate` states (`Open / Quiesced / ProbeAvailable / ProbeClaimed / CandidateProving`) including compile-time exhaustiveness pinning via `when`
- `ProbeToken.toString()` redaction lock (returns `[REDACTED]`, never the raw `Long` value)
- `ProbeAvailable.toString()` / `ProbeClaimed.toString()` / `ClaimedProbe.toString()` (all three carry explicit `override fun toString()` in the source) wrap their token via `[REDACTED]` and assert the raw hex/decimal token never leaks through the data-class string interpolation
- `CandidateProving` type-level absence of any token-like field pinned via `!toString().contains("token", ignoreCase = true)` — case-insensitive so adding `val probeToken: ProbeToken` / `val recoveryToken: ...` / `TOKEN_VALUE` / any other token-named property to `CandidateProving` breaks this test before any runtime path can leak a value
- `simpleKind()` extension returns the expected telemetry-safe label (`"Open"` / `"Quiesced"` / `"ProbeAvailable"` / `"ProbeClaimed"` / `"CandidateProving"`) for each of the 5 states
- `ProbeBudget.MAX_ATTEMPTS_LOCKED == 5` and `ProbeBudget.MAX_ELAPSED_MS_LOCKED == 120_000L` locked-constant pins
- Sealed-hierarchy distinctness + compile-time `when` exhaustiveness for `WsReconnectPermit` (`OpenPermit / ClaimedProbe / LoopRetired`) / `ClaimResult` (`Claimed / Failure`) / `ProbeIssueResult` (`ProbeIssued / Rejected`) / `RouteChangeOutcome` (`OpenReconnect / StickyRecovery / QuiescencePreserved`)
- `ProbeIssueResult.ProbeIssued.toString()` redacts token (source line 273 has explicit `override`)
- Enum exhaustiveness for `ClaimFailureReason` (4 values, order-locked) and `ProbeIssueRejectReason` (3 values, order-locked)
- Zero instantiation of production classes from outside `WsReconnectGate.kt`

**Release-pin test surface (`ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest.kt`):**

- Release block of `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` carries the literal `buildConfigField("String", "RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED", "\"0\"")`
- Debug block does NOT carry the literal pin (mirror-image regression check)
- Debug block declares `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` via `localOrEnv("reconnectQuiesce", "RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED", "0")` for operator opt-in via `-PreconnectQuiesce=1`

**Verification PASSED locally:**

- `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` — 27 structural cells PASS
- `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest --tests 'ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest'` — 3 cells PASS
- `:apps:android:assembleRelease` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- `:apps:android:verifyR8StripsTestSeams` — `verifyR8StripsTestSeams PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* classes or members survived` (the gate-only carve-out introduces no `*ForTest*` / `debugForce*` / `*Synthetic*` seams so the verifier passes trivially with respect to this PR's diff)

**What this PR ships:**

- `shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/WsReconnectGate.kt` — 447 LOC, byte-identical with PR #330's source.
- `shared/core/transport/src/commonTest/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/WsReconnectGateStructuralTest.kt` — 508 LOC fresh structural test.
- `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` — +53 LOC adding `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` flag to debug block (via `localOrEnv("reconnectQuiesce", ...)`) and release block (literal `"0"` pin).
- `apps/android/src/androidUnitTest/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest.kt` — 159 LOC release-pin test mirroring `Mode2DebugForceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest`.

**What this PR does NOT ship:**

- No `RestStateMachine` modifications. No `KtorRelayTransport` modifications. No `TransportRewalkCoordinator` modifications. No `RestFallbackOrchestrator` modifications. No `AppContainer` wiring.
- No `WsReconnectGateProvider` / `RewalkCoordinatorGateProvider` implementations (the gate file declares the interfaces but the production implementation lives on the MC implementation PR alongside the state-transition logic).
- No `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` (PR #330's 1172-LOC integration suite). No `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt`. Both integration-scoped per §13.5 and deferred to the MC implementation PR.
- No `KtorRelayTransport` ProGuard discipline extension. The gate file introduces no new `KtorRelayTransport` members so the narrowed keep block at `apps/android/proguard-rules.pro` is unchanged.
- No activation of the quiescence contract. Release-pinned `"0"`; no production code path reads the flag in this PR's diff.

**Sequencing (per §13.2 of the MC half mini-lock, corrected by §13.5):**

This PR is step (1) of the six-step contract. Next steps:

- Step (2): this PR merges; becomes qualifying base for the MC implementation PR.
- Step (3): MC implementation PR opens stacked on the landed carve-out, brings `RestStateMachine` state-transition logic + `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` + `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt` + §4.2 + §4.3 + §6 hypothesis assertions per the MC half mini-lock.
- Step (4): MC PASS + already-landed MB PASS (PR #353 squash `ed3406eb`) satisfies the two H-ME validation halves and UNLOCKS the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run.
- Step (5): Wi-Fi smoke PASS closes B1 per `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11.
- Step (6): PR #330 advances per its own mini-lock contract after B1 closes.

**Key commits:** TBD (squash SHA backfilled in MASTER_TIMELINE on merge).

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK §13.1 test-scope correction (gate-only carve-out test surface restored to gate-in-isolation)

**Outcome:** Path C corrective amendment. A facts-first read of the test files referenced by §13.1 (PR #330 commit `6f49cd89`), performed by the carve-out implementer BEFORE writing any code, surfaced a scope misreading in the original §13.1 lock: `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` (1172 LOC) is NOT a unit test of `WsReconnectGate.kt` in isolation. Its `newSm()` helper instantiates `RestStateMachine` directly with the new constructor parameters PR #330 adds (`reconnectQuiescenceEnabled`, `currentKindProvider`, `tokenSource`) and its `armSticky()` helper calls `sm.onEvent(RestStateMachine.Event.WsSessionEnded(...))`, exercising gate state-transition logic that lives **inside `RestStateMachine`**, not inside `WsReconnectGate.kt`. The gate file itself is pure type-and-interface declaration: 5 sealed `WsReconnectGate` states, `ProbeToken` value class with `[REDACTED]` `toString()`, `ProbeBudget` with locked constants, four sealed hierarchies for permits / results / outcomes, two abstract provider interfaces, a `simpleKind()` extension — no state-transition, transport-routing, or provider-implementation logic in the file itself (the only runtime code is type-level: `toString()` redaction overrides on `ProbeToken / ProbeAvailable / ProbeClaimed / ClaimedProbe`, plus the `simpleKind()` telemetry-label extension). The two provider interfaces are declared but NOT implemented in this file; their implementations live on `RestStateMachine` outside the carve-out's scope. `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt` is similarly integration-scoped.

**Why this matters:** §13.1's MUST NOT bullet 3 explicitly forbids "PR #330's full RestStateMachine / KtorRelayTransport / TransportRewalkCoordinator modifications" in the carve-out — "Only the gate component compiles + unit-tests; the larger production-behaviour rewrites stay on PR #330's branch." Bringing `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` verbatim would force importing those `RestStateMachine` modifications, putting the §13.1 MUST IN and MUST NOT bullets in direct conflict. The original wording ("at minimum `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` (PR #330's 1172 LOC) brought across or re-authored") reflected an unverified assumption that the file was gate-in-isolation; the facts-first recon refuted that assumption.

**Three paths considered:**

- **Path A** — open gate-only carve-out without `WsReconnectGateTest.kt`; write fresh structural tests; explain in PR body. Rejected because §13.1 already on master explicitly names the file as MUST IN; reviewer would correctly catch a §13.1 violation in the carve-out PR.
- **Path B** — bring `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` verbatim AND the `RestStateMachine` changes needed to compile it. Rejected because it violates §13.1 MUST NOT bullet 3 and breaks the whole gate-only-carve-out intent.
- **Path C** — small docs-only amendment now correcting §13.1's test scope BEFORE opening the carve-out; carve-out then opens against the corrected wording. CHOSEN.

**What this PR ships:**

- **`docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-mc-half-mini-lock.md`** — §13.1 "Targeted unit tests" bullet replaced with a "Fresh structural unit tests for the gate types" bullet that lists the gate file's actual surface to cover (sealed-class distinctness, `ProbeToken.toString` redaction, `CandidateProving` type-level absence of `token`, `simpleKind()` coverage, `ProbeBudget` constant pins, sealed-hierarchy distinctness for `WsReconnectPermit / ClaimResult / ProbeIssueResult / RouteChangeOutcome`, enum exhaustiveness for `ClaimFailureReason / ProbeIssueRejectReason`). §13.1 MUST NOT extended with explicit "defer to MC PR" entries for both `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` and `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt`. §13.4 "Do NOT" line extended to forbid bringing either integration test into the carve-out. New §13.5 ("Test scope correction — recon finding") records the discovery + cites the line numbers in `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` that depend on `RestStateMachine`. §1 status header line updated.
- **`docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`** — this entry.
- **`docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md`** — new-PR pointer entry.

**What this PR does NOT change:**

- §1-§12 of the mini-lock stay in force.
- §4 binding constraints (L-13.3.1 / .3 / .4 / .5 / .11) remain binding on the MC implementation PR.
- §6 load-bearing hypotheses remain binding on the MC implementation PR.
- §7 acceptance-gate criteria for MC PASS / MC PARTIAL / MC FAIL remain unchanged.
- §13.2 sequencing — six-step contract gate-carve-out → MC implementation PR → Wi-Fi smoke → B1 closure unchanged.
- §13.3 carry-forward statement unchanged.
- §13.4 hand-off contract unchanged at the structural level (only the "Do NOT" line gains the integration-test-deferral bullet).
- Strategy 1 lock from the §13 amendment proper (PR #355 squash `ca12a98c`) — unchanged.
- PR #330's contract. PR #353 (MB half) — unchanged. The methodology recon's H-ME verdict — unchanged.
- L1 mini-lock + L1 §5.1 Option A amendment + path-2 step 2 narrowing PR — unchanged.

**Follow-up:** After this amendment merges on master, the gate-only carve-out PR opens against §13.1's corrected test-scope wording. It brings `WsReconnectGate.kt` (verbatim or re-authored) + a fresh structural unit-test file (~100-150 LOC) + `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED="0"` BuildConfig flag + companion release-pin test + narrowed ProGuard discipline extension (only if new `KtorRelayTransport` members are surfaced — per the gate file content as it stands, none are). Wiring stubs (constructor parameters, AppContainer-side wire-up) are NOT mandatory and the expected default is "no wiring stubs" — extracting `WsReconnectGate.kt` imposes no compile-time dependency on any existing class. If wiring is introduced anyway, the carve-out PR body MUST cite the specific compile-time dependency that forced it. No `RestStateMachine` modifications either way. The `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` (1172 LOC) and `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest.kt` lift into the MC implementation PR alongside the gate's state-transition implementation on `RestStateMachine`.

**Key commits:** TBD (this PR's squash SHA backfilled in MASTER_TIMELINE on merge).

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK §13 amendment — Strategy 1 lock (gate-only carve-out from PR #330)

**Outcome:** Operator locked §5 Strategy 1 — carve a gate-only PR out of PR #330 — with rationale: HIGH honesty profile, mirrors path-2 step 2 narrowing carve-out pattern (PR #352 squash `a28bb1d2`), preserves L-13.3.1, avoids coupling MC verdict to PR #330's review lifecycle (Strategy 2 cost) or weakening "both halves required" lock (Strategy 3 cost). Strategies 2 and 3 are NOT carried forward.

Amendment appends §13 to `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-mc-half-mini-lock.md` (~95 LOC) and updates the §1 status line. §13 has four subsections:

- **§13.1 Gate-only carve-out scope** — pins what MUST be in the carve-out's initial diff (`WsReconnectGate.kt` from PR #330's commit `6f49cd89` brought verbatim or re-authored / targeted unit tests `WsReconnectGateTest.kt` / new BuildConfig flag `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` defaulting `"0"` in release block with debug `localOrEnv` / companion `ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest` / minimal wiring stubs to make the gate compileable + unit-testable in isolation / narrowed ProGuard discipline extension if new `KtorRelayTransport` members are introduced) and what MUST stay out (activation of the quiescence contract — flag stays `"0"` / runtime behaviour changes in unrelated transport paths / PR #330's full RestStateMachine + KtorRelayTransport + TransportRewalkCoordinator modifications / changes to PR #330's contract / synthetic-trigger code from PR #353 / MC test cells beyond gate's own unit tests).
- **§13.2 Sequencing** — six steps from carve-out PR open through B1 closure, consistent with the §9 / §12 "Wi-Fi smoke is the final field-shape check before B1 closes" contract: (1) gate-only carve-out PR opens / (2) merges on master, becomes qualifying base for MC implementation PR / (3) MC implementation PR opens stacked on landed gate / (4) MC PASS + already-landed MB PASS satisfies the two H-ME validation halves and UNLOCKS the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run — does NOT close B1 on its own / (5) Wi-Fi smoke run opens as separate operator-scheduled item; Wi-Fi smoke PASS is what closes B1 per `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 / (6) PR #330 advances per its own mini-lock contract after B1 closes (i.e., after MC PASS + MB PASS unlocked the smoke AND the smoke itself PASSed). Carve-out reduces PR #330's effective diff (gate already on master), simplifying eventual integration.
- **§13.3 What this amendment does NOT change** — §1-§12 stay in force; Strategy 2/3 NOT carried forward; §4 binding constraints remain binding on MC implementation PR; §6 hypotheses remain binding; §7 acceptance-gate criteria for MC PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL unchanged (the §7.1 MC PASS disposition *wording* aligned to the §13.2 sequencing — MC + MB unlocks Wi-Fi smoke; B1 closes only after smoke PASS — matching the §9 / §12 contract already in force); PR #330's contract NOT amended; PR #353 NOT amended; H-ME verdict NOT amended; L1 mini-lock + L1 §5.1 Option A amendment + path-2 step 2 narrowing PR all stay in force.
- **§13.4 Hand-off to the gate-only carve-out PR** — opens AFTER this amendment merges; cites this amendment SHA + PR #330's gate-source provenance; states carve-out scope per §13.1 explicitly; documents BuildConfig flag wiring + release pin; includes companion release-pin test; includes narrowed ProGuard extension if needed; states explicitly that carve-out is structural — no observable production transport behaviour change when flag is `"0"` (bytecode itself differs due to new class files + BuildConfig field, but no production code path observes a different runtime behaviour); states that PR #330 contract NOT amended; that MB half NOT amended; that L1 mini-lock + path-2 step 2 narrowing all stay in force. After carve-out merges, MC implementation PR's preconditions per §8 are satisfied. Do NOT open carve-out with flag pinned `"1"`. Do NOT skip companion release-pin test. Do NOT touch production runtime path when flag is `"0"`. Do NOT pre-empt MC implementation PR scope.

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK Open; §5 Strategy 1 locked. Next deliverable: gate-only carve-out PR per §13.4 hand-off contract. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. Methodology recon stays Closed with verdict H-ME unchanged. L1 mini-lock + MB half (PR #353) + path-2 step 2 narrowing (PR #352) unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — Strategy 1 lock amendment to MC half mini-lock (~95 LOC §13 append + 2-line status header update). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-mc-strategy1-lock`. Off master `b9e979f2`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator opens the gate-only carve-out PR per §13.4 after this amendment merges. NOT auto-started.
- After carve-out merges: MC implementation PR opens stacked on the landed gate commit.
- After MC PASS + the already-landed MB PASS: the Wi-Fi smoke run mini-lock opens (the smoke is the final field-shape check per §9 / §12 of the MC half mini-lock). B1 closes after Wi-Fi smoke PASS, NOT after MC + MB alone.

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK opened — implementation scope-lock for MC half of H-ME

**Outcome:** Path-2 step 4 — methodology scope-lock for the MC half of the H-ME closure verdict. Opens immediately after PR #353 (the MB half) merged earlier the same day. Per the methodology recon's H-ME verdict (PR #349 squash `54f2e50d`) lock L-13.3.1 ("both halves required"), B1 closure for `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 needs MC PASS + MB PASS on record. MB landed in PR #353 squash `ed3406eb`; MC is the remaining deliverable.

New track-doc at `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-mc-half-mini-lock.md` (168 lines) scopes the MC implementation. The mini-lock binds carried-forward locks from the methodology recon's §13.3 closure verdict that apply to the MC half: L-13.3.1 both halves required (§4.1) / L-13.3.3 sequential dispatcher order load-bearing (§4.2) / L-13.3.4 closeOrigin="synthetic" non-branching discipline (§4.3) / L-13.3.5 maybeRetryBootstrap() branch scope gap (§4.4) / L-13.3.11 acceptance matrix is test floor (§4.5). Locks that govern only the MB half (L-13.3.2 / L-13.3.6 / L-13.3.7 / L-13.3.8 / L-13.3.9 / L-13.3.10) are NOT re-bound — PR #353 satisfied them and they stay in force on their own.

**§5 strategy discrimination** — the gate component (`WsReconnectGate`) is introduced by PR #330 and does NOT exist on master HEAD. Three strategies for where MC tests live, each with honesty profile:

- **Strategy 1** — carve a gate-only PR out of PR #330 (mirror of path-2 step 2's narrowing carve-out pattern), land gate code on master without activating the quiescence contract, then MC tests stack on the landed gate. HIGH honesty profile; ~1-2 PR sequencing; mirrors the path-2 step 2 narrowing PR's risk shape.
- **Strategy 2** — MC tests added as commits ON PR #330's branch; MC PASS = PR #330's CI green. MEDIUM honesty; zero new PRs; couples MC to PR #330's review cycle.
- **Strategy 3** — MC deferred until after PR #330 merges; B1 conditionally closes on MB-only with explicit deferral amendment to `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11. LOW honesty (violates L-13.3.1); zero immediate PRs; fallback only if Strategies 1 + 2 fail feasibility.

The mini-lock does NOT pre-decide the strategy. Operator picks via amendment or implementation PR body.

**§6 load-bearing hypotheses** — MC MUST close the gate-mediated Phase B hypotheses N-1 identified as NOT COVERED on master HEAD (H-330-Quiesces-Storm / H-330-Single-Probe-Per-RouteChange / H-330-No-Self-Reentry) and SHOULD reinforce the gate-coordinated layer of PARTIAL ones (H-330-Preserves-REST / H-330-Probe-Lives-60s / H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups).

**§7 acceptance gates** — three closure dispositions (MC PASS / MC PARTIAL / MC FAIL). MC PASS combined with the already-landed MB PASS satisfies the two H-ME validation halves and unlocks the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run as a separate operator-scheduled item; B1 closes only after Wi-Fi smoke PASS. MC PARTIAL surfaces specific failures and leaves PR #330 Draft / HOLD; MC FAIL means PR #330's gate design has a model-level defect and the next step is operator-led re-design.

**§8 preconditions** — implementation PR opens only after strategy is locked + MB is on record (already satisfied at this mini-lock's open).

**§9 hand-off** — implementation PR cites this mini-lock + the H-ME verdict + the MB half; documents the chosen strategy; covers the §4 + §6 + §7 requirements. After MC PASS the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run opens as a separate operator-scheduled item. After smoke PASS, B1 closes.

**§10 park conditions** — P-1 all strategies fail feasibility / P-2 operator unavailable / P-3 PR #330's gate component design changes materially.

**§11 what's NOT pre-decided** — the chosen strategy; exact test files; whether PARTIAL-hypothesis coverage is "thorough enough"; numeric values for gate constants; any change to PR #330's mini-lock or H-ME verdict or L1 mini-lock; the Wi-Fi smoke procedure.

Per §9 hand-off rule: the implementation PR's commit message + body MUST cite this mini-lock's squash SHA verbatim and document the chosen §5 strategy. Pre-merge implementation work without a strategy choice is rejected at review.

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-MC-HALF-MINI-LOCK Open. MC implementation is the next deliverable when operator schedules. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. Methodology recon stays Closed with verdict H-ME unchanged. L1 mini-lock + MB half unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — MC half mini-lock (168-line track-doc). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-mc-half-mini-lock`. Off master `ed3406eb`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator picks a §5 strategy. If Strategy 1: opens the gate-only carve-out PR next (mirror of path-2 step 2). If Strategy 2: the MC commits go on PR #330's branch. If Strategy 3: opens an amendment to `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 first.
- MC implementation PR follows the chosen strategy.
- After MC PASS: controlled Wi-Fi smoke run procedure mini-lock opens.
- After smoke PASS: B1 closes; PR #330's own mini-lock allows it to advance.

### 2026-06-30 · Path-2 step 3 — L1 synthetic-trigger implementation (MB half of H-ME; Option A stacked on a28bb1d2)

**Outcome:** Path-2 step 3 — first code PR delivering the MB half of the H-ME closure verdict. Stacks on path-2 step 2 (`a28bb1d2`) under the L1 mini-lock §5.1 Option A precondition so the initial diff is focused on the MB synthetic-trigger surface only (no ProGuard / R8 changes — those are inherited from base).

Implementation closes all eleven L1 mini-lock locks plus the optional 6th `SyntheticTriggerResult` member:

- **§4.6 / §4.7 / §5.1 / §6 / §7 / §8** — all binding constraints satisfied; §5.1 satisfied via Option A.
- **§5.2 four-layer protected operator surface** — `DebugForceMode2Activity` mirrors `S6BreakerTriggerActivity` verbatim: (1) declared only in `apps/android/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`; (2) `android:permission="android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL"`; (3) `onCreate` re-checks `BuildConfig.DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION == "1"` AND `BuildConfig.DEBUG == true`; (4) `AppContainer.triggerDebugForceMode2()` re-checks BuildConfig + `RestStateMachine.isStickyOrRecoveryActive`, then the `KtorRelayTransport` constructor-injected `debugForceMode2Enabled: Boolean` defaults to `false` in release as the final backstop.
- **§7.2 D-1 dedup choice** — state-transition guard via `RestStateMachine.onWsSessionEnded`'s `RestActive` arm. Pre-flight analysis (2026-06-30) found `RestStateMachine.lastObservedEpoch` is Connected-side only; the duplicate-`Ended`-for-same-epoch scenario is naturally absorbed because the first `Ended` (synthetic OR real) transitions `WsActive → RestActive` and the second enters the `RestActive` arm where the comment says "Already in REST mode — a WS session close is expected and irrelevant". Sequential dispatcher consumption guarantees state visibility between events. No new dedup code required.
- **§7.2 D-1 edge case** closed via the 6th `RefusedAlreadyArmed` member of `SyntheticTriggerResult`. Synthetic refuses to fire if `RestStateMachine.isStickyOrRecoveryActive == true` (sticky armed OR recovery in flight) so an operator-initiated trigger does not falsely fail an in-progress recovery candidate.

**Pre-flight performed before greenlight:** §4-§9 mini-lock re-read on master; D-1/D-2/D-3 evaluation (D-1 selected based on state-transition guard analysis, not `lastObservedEpoch` filter); S6BreakerTriggerActivity four-layer pattern verified for verbatim copy; acceptance matrix markers re-verified against current master `a28bb1d2` (`mode_2_signature_matched action=`, `sticky_armed`, `sticky_cleared`, `MODE_2_MIN_DURATION_MS=25_000L`, `MODE_2_MAX_DURATION_MS=65_000L`) and PR #330 head `6f49cd89` (`ws_reconnect_quiesced`, `ws_recovery_probe_granted`, `ws_reconnect_resumed`, `ws_reconnect_open proof=`, plus `ws_recovery_proof_rejected` / `ws_recovery_route_change_revoked` / `ws_recovery_probe_attempt_ignored` / `ws_recovery_probe_attempt_failed` / `ws_recovery_probe_exhausted` for FAIL criteria). Zero marker drift.

**Verified locally on branch head `feat/quiescence-l1-synthetic-trigger`:**

- `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` (including the new `SyntheticTriggerResultTest` and `KtorRelayTransportDebugForceMode2Test`) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest` (including the 3 new androidUnitTest cells) → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- `:apps:android:assembleRelease` → `verifyR8StripsTestSeams self-test PASS — parser handles ranged method lines + class-level deny.` + `verifyR8StripsTestSeams PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* classes or members survived on any phantom.* class.` + BUILD SUCCESSFUL.

The verifier PASS is the load-bearing release-binary safety guarantee: R8 strips `debugForceMode2Synthetic` / `setStateForTest` / `bumpSessionEpochForTest` / `resetOneShotLatchForTest` / `currentSessionEpoch` getter / `SyntheticTriggerResult` class on standard reachability analysis (no production code calls reach them in release because `DebugForceMode2Activity` is debug-overlay-only AND `AppContainer.triggerDebugForceMode2` short-circuits on `BuildConfig.DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION != "1"` AND the constructor-injected Boolean is `false`).

**Track status:** L1 mini-lock implementation MB half DELIVERED. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. B1 closure remains gated on the MC half (separate scope-lock; opens separately) AND a controlled Wi-Fi smoke run after both halves merge.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this PR)** — L1 synthetic-trigger implementation (10 files, ~1300 LOC). Branch `feat/quiescence-l1-synthetic-trigger`. Off master `a28bb1d2`.

**Follow-ups:**

- MC half scope-lock opens separately (NOT this PR's question). Likely extends `RestStateMachineTest` / `WsActivePollJobLifecycleTest` infrastructure or stacks on PR #330's added test files once PR #330's gate component lands.
- After both halves merge: controlled Wi-Fi smoke run validates the end-to-end quiescence chain.
- After Wi-Fi smoke PASS: B1 acceptance gate closes; PR #330 may proceed to Ready / smoke retry per its own mini-lock (operator decision).

### 2026-06-30 · Path-2 step 2 — ProGuard narrowing + verifyR8StripsTestSeams Gradle task + structural pin test (qualifying narrowing commit for L1 Option A)

**Outcome:** First code change in the path-2 sequence after the methodology recon closed with H-ME verdict + the L1 mini-lock opened + the §5.1 Option A amendment. Narrowing-only PR with three artefacts: (a) `apps/android/proguard-rules.pro` removes the over-broad `-keep class phantom.core.transport.KtorRelayTransport { *; }` wildcard and replaces it with five targeted `-keepclassmembers` entries justified per call site / (b) `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` adds the `verifyR8StripsTestSeams` Gradle task wired as `finalizedBy assembleRelease` with deny patterns `*ForTest*` / `debugForce*` / `*Synthetic*` filtered to skip R8-internal `$$ExternalSyntheticLambda` / `$$InternalSyntheticLambda` containers / (c) new `KtorRelayTransportProguardNarrowingPinTest` in `androidUnitTest` structurally pins the wildcard absence + the targeted keep block presence + each of the five required member names. The narrowing-only PR is intended to merge first; the L1 implementation PR then opens under L1 mini-lock §5.1 Option A citing this PR's squash SHA verbatim.

**Five targeted keeps in `proguard-rules.pro` (each member is accessed by name from `HybridRelayTransport` via the concrete `KtorRelayTransport` type, not via the `RelayTransport` interface — R8 cannot prove reachability through interface dispatch alone):**

| Member | Call site | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| `wsSessionLifecycle` | `HybridRelayTransport.kt:495` | R3.6 lifecycle channel |
| `outboundAckDeadlineExpired` | `HybridRelayTransport.kt:510` | PR-D1d ACK-deadline expiry flow |
| `inboundStalled` | `HybridRelayTransport.kt:553` | PR-RECV-DIAG1 inbound stall flow |
| `snapshotPendingOutbound()` | `HybridRelayTransport.kt:894` | PR-D1c WS pending-outbound snapshot |
| `markPendingOutboundAcceptedByFallback(String)` | `HybridRelayTransport.kt:946 / :954` | PR-D1c mark-accepted API |

Each entry includes the file:line citation and a one-line justification in `proguard-rules.pro` itself; the structural pin test enforces the listed names cannot be silently dropped.

**`verifyR8StripsTestSeams` task design:**

- Reads `apps/android/build/outputs/mapping/release/mapping.txt` after `assembleRelease`.
- Parses each `phantom.*` class block.
- Skips R8-internal lambda capture containers (`$$ExternalSyntheticLambda`, `$$InternalSyntheticLambda`) and compiler-synthesised member names (those starting with `$`).
- For every other phantom member, matches against deny patterns: `*ForTest*` / `debugForce*` / `*Synthetic*`.
- Fails the release build with the full violation list if any match.

**Verified locally:**

- Structural pin test: `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest --tests "phantom.android.transport.KtorRelayTransportProguardNarrowingPinTest"` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Release build + verifier: `:apps:android:assembleRelease` → `verifyR8StripsTestSeams PASS — no *ForTest* / debugForce* / *Synthetic* members survived on any phantom.* class.` + BUILD SUCCESSFUL.
- Negative-control attempted (re-add wildcard to file). Result: clean master HEAD has no `*ForTest*` / `debugForce*` / `*Synthetic*` members on `KtorRelayTransport`, so the wildcard alone does not trip the verifier. The verifier is forward-looking — when the L1 implementation PR introduces `debugForceMode2Synthetic` and any `*Synthetic*` companion classes, re-adding the wildcard at THAT point will trip the verifier with surviving members. Documented in the PR body.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out (transport-adjacent):** changes are release-only by nature — debug builds are not affected by ProGuard rules. The smoke-test substitute IS the `verifyR8StripsTestSeams` Gradle task itself, which demonstrates the release APK is successfully narrowed. PR body documents the carve-out explicitly.

**What this PR does NOT do:**

- No `KtorRelayTransport` source changes.
- No BuildConfig flags, no debug Activity, no synthetic-trigger code, no L1 implementation work.
- No PR #330 changes — Draft / HOLD unchanged.
- No expansion of deny patterns beyond what the L1 mini-lock locked (`*ForTest*` / `debugForce*` / `*Synthetic*`). Future debug-only naming MUST satisfy one of these patterns OR be stripped by R8 on its own.

**Track status:** L1 implementation mini-lock §5.1 Option A precondition can now point at this PR's eventual squash SHA. Next operator step: open L1 implementation PR under Option A after this narrowing PR merges. NOT auto-started.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this PR)** — narrowing-only code change (3 files: proguard-rules.pro / build.gradle.kts / new androidUnitTest pin test). Branch `feat/proguard-narrowing-r8-strip-verification`. Off master `e42ca9c2`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator opens L1 implementation PR under §5.1 Option A citing this PR's squash SHA verbatim, after this PR merges. NOT auto-started.
- MC half scope-lock opens separately.
- Controlled Wi-Fi smoke run opens AFTER both halves merge AND MC PASS + MB PASS land on record.

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-L1-SYNTHETIC-MINI-LOCK amendment — §5.1 Option A loosened to accept any qualifying narrowing commit (unblocks path-2 separate narrowing-only PR sequence)

**Outcome:** Operator-chosen path-2 sequence (separate narrowing-only PR → L1 implementation PR under Option A) hit a literal-wording blocker in the just-merged mini-lock at PR #350 squash `e6a162d9`: §5.1 Option A said "Stack on already-landed PR #330 narrowing commit", which created an unintended dependency loop — PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD until B1 closes; B1 closes only after MB PASS lands; MB lands only after the implementation PR opens; the implementation PR opens only under Option A or Option B; Option A required PR #330's narrowing. The loop locks all forward motion under Option A.

This amendment loosens §5.1 Option A's literal text to: "Stack on **any already-landed narrowing commit that provides equivalent ProGuard removal + R8 strip verification**". Defence-in-depth requirement is unchanged — the narrowing commit must (i) remove the `-keep class phantom.core.transport.KtorRelayTransport { *; }` wildcard and (ii) add an R8-strip verification mechanism that fails the release build on any surviving member that should not survive (`verifyR8StripsTestSeams` Gradle task pattern from PR #330's mini-lock §2 is the reference shape, but any equivalent mechanism qualifies). The qualifying narrowing commit MAY come from PR #330 if PR #330 ships its narrowing portion (e.g., as a carved-out independent PR or as part of its eventual merge), OR it MAY come from a separate independent narrowing-only PR opened specifically to unblock this mini-lock.

Amendment scope:

- **§5.1 Option A text** rewritten to accept either source (PR #330's narrowing OR a separate independent narrowing PR), with the defence-in-depth requirement unchanged.
- **§5.1 inline amendment note** added below Option B paragraph, documenting the original text + the dependency loop + the amendment's defence-in-depth preservation.
- **§10 P-1 park condition** broadened from "PR #330's narrowing plan changes" to "the landed-narrowing reference changes (whether that source is PR #330 or a separate independent narrowing PR)".

What this amendment does NOT change:

- Option B (include narrowing in the same initial implementation PR diff) is unchanged.
- The "MUST NOT open without Option A or Option B in initial diff" rule is unchanged.
- All eleven binding locks L-13.3.1 through L-13.3.11 stay in force.
- The two BLOCKERS L-13.3.6 + L-13.3.7 remain preconditions for the implementation PR's initial diff.
- `SyntheticTriggerResult` sealed class, race contract requirements, acceptance matrix floor, S6-style four-layer operator surface — all unchanged.

**Operator-chosen path-2 sequence enabled by this amendment:**

1. This amendment PR merges first (this entry).
2. **Separate narrowing-only PR** opens next: only `apps/android/proguard-rules.pro` removal of the wildcard + `verifyR8StripsTestSeams`-equivalent Gradle task + R8 strip verification test. NO synthetic-trigger code. Smaller, cleaner diff, separate review surface.
3. **L1 implementation PR** opens after narrowing-only PR merges: cites the narrowing commit verbatim under Option A, focuses entire initial diff on MB synthetic-trigger code + §6/§7/§8 requirements.
4. **MC half scope-lock** opens separately (NOT this amendment's question).
5. **Controlled Wi-Fi smoke run** opens AFTER both halves merge AND MC PASS + MB PASS land on record.

This sequence keeps PR #330 untouched (still Draft / HOLD) and avoids the path-1 risk of mixing release-binary safety with synthetic-trigger code in one large review surface.

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-L1-SYNTHETIC-MINI-LOCK Open with §5.1 + §10 amended. Next operator step: open the narrowing-only PR per path-2 step 2 above; do NOT auto-start. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. Methodology recon Closed with verdict H-ME unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — amendment to §5.1 Option A + §10 P-1 + inline amendment note (~30 LOC). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-l1-minilock-amendment-option-a`. Off master `e6a162d9`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator opens the narrowing-only PR per path-2 step 2 after this amendment merges. Scope: ProGuard removal of `-keep class phantom.core.transport.KtorRelayTransport { *; }` wildcard + `verifyR8StripsTestSeams`-equivalent Gradle task + R8 strip verification test. NO synthetic-trigger code in this narrowing PR. NOT auto-started by this amendment.
- After narrowing-only PR merges, L1 implementation PR opens under §5.1 Option A citing the narrowing commit verbatim. NOT auto-started.
- MC half scope-lock opens separately. NOT auto-started.

### 2026-06-30 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-L1-SYNTHETIC-MINI-LOCK opened — implementation scope-lock for MB half of H-ME

**Outcome:** Operator greenlit opening the MB-half implementation scope-lock immediately after the methodology recon closed with H-ME verdict (PR #349 squash `54f2e50d`). New track-doc at `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-l1-synthetic-mini-lock.md` (227 lines) formalises the L1 synthetic-trigger implementation contract before any code lands.

The mini-lock binds the implementation PR to all eleven locks `L-13.3.1` through `L-13.3.11` from the methodology recon's §13.3 closure verdict, split across §4 + §5 + §7 (§4 carries the eight non-blocker / non-race locks L-13.3.1 / .2 / .3 / .4 / .5 / .8 / .10 / .11; §5 carries the two BLOCKER locks L-13.3.6 / L-13.3.7 as preconditions that the implementation PR's initial diff MUST already satisfy — Option A "stack on already-landed PR #330 narrowing commit cited verbatim" or Option B "include ProGuard narrowing + R8 verification in the same initial implementation PR diff, before or alongside any synthetic-trigger code"; §5.2 four-layer protected operator surface with four-layer mapping required for any operator-trigger shape, raw `am broadcast` BroadcastReceiver without explicit four-layer mapping forbidden; §7 carries the L-13.3.9 race-contract lock and pins three implementation-PR-binding resolution requirements but does NOT resolve the race itself — single epoch snapshot at top of method, receiving-side dedup mechanism chosen from D-1 / D-2 / D-3 (rely on RestStateMachine epoch filter / dispatcher tuple dedup / method-level mutex), adversarial race-window tests that force a real session death between guard and `trySend`); formalises the `SyntheticTriggerResult` typed-return contract concretely as a sealed class with five required members `Fired / RefusedDisabled / RefusedNotConnected / RefusedDurationOutOfRange / RefusedAlreadyFired` plus the L-13.3.5-derived optional sixth `RefusedNoRestCapability` (§6); binds the implementation PR's test set to the source-grounded acceptance matrix at `C:\temp\quiescence-h-me-council-2026-06-29\tests.md` as test floor not ceiling (§8); specifies the implementation PR's hand-off contract — when it may open, what it must contain, what verdict it must produce (§9); records three park conditions (P-1 PR #330's narrowing plan changes / P-2 operator unavailable / P-3 architectural change in `KtorRelayTransport` or dispatcher); enumerates what is NOT pre-decided so the implementation PR retains design freedom on file naming, signature permission string, exact component name, exact dedup option, Gradle task implementation.

Per §9 hand-off rule of the parent methodology recon and per this mini-lock's own §9: the implementation PR opens ONLY after this mini-lock merges. Pre-merge implementation work is rejected at review. The implementation PR's commit message + body MUST cite this mini-lock's squash SHA + the methodology recon's H-ME verdict SHA (`54f2e50d`) verbatim, and MUST state explicitly that B1 closure requires the MC half ALSO PASS (this PR delivers MB only).

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-L1-SYNTHETIC-MINI-LOCK Open. Implementation PR is the next deliverable when operator schedules; do NOT auto-start. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §11 / §12 unchanged. Methodology recon stays Closed with verdict H-ME.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — L1 synthetic-trigger implementation mini-lock (227-line track-doc). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-l1-synthetic-mini-lock`. Off master `54f2e50d`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator schedules the implementation PR. Pre-conditions: §5.1 Option A or Option B chosen (ProGuard narrowing satisfied), §5.2 four-layer operator surface mapping documented and tested, §6 `SyntheticTriggerResult` sealed class specified, §7.2 dedup option D-1 / D-2 / D-3 chosen and §7.3 adversarial tests included, §8 acceptance matrix re-verified against current master at opening, §9 hand-off items satisfied.
- MC half scope-lock opens separately (NOT this mini-lock's question). Likely stacks on PR #330's added test files or extends on-master test infrastructure once PR #330's gate component lands.
- Controlled Wi-Fi smoke run procedure opens AFTER both halves merge AND MC PASS + MB PASS land on record.

### 2026-06-29 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 closed with H-ME verdict — state-machine integration validation + L1 synthetic field trigger

**Outcome:** Operator pivoted to closure per §6 acceptance gate #2 (combination MC + MB = H-ME) after the three source-read instruments N-1 + N-2 + N-3 produced sufficient evidence. NOT N-4 (no third network class identified within reasonable operator effort). NOT N-5 (release-gate amendment is not validation). NOT H-MC alone (master HEAD fakes are interface-shaped, not lifecycle-shaped per N-2 — state-machine tests alone cannot assert field-shape match). The recon's status flips from Open to **Closed (verdict H-ME, 2026-06-29)** in track-doc §1 + §13. PR #348 squash `98ee7e09` is the last known master at close.

Council review by four agents before locking the verdict (durables at `C:\temp\quiescence-h-me-council-2026-06-29\{architect,implementation,tests,security}.md`):

- **Architect:** H-ME RIGHT WITH CAVEATS. Five load-bearing caveats promoted to §13.3 locks: both halves required (L-13.3.1), L1 mandatory not L2 (L-13.3.2), sequential dispatcher order load-bearing (L-13.3.3), `closeOrigin="synthetic"` non-branching discipline (L-13.3.4), `maybeRetryBootstrap()` branch scope gap (L-13.3.5).
- **Implementation:** L1 FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS. Three P2 concerns; one (P2-3 check-then-trySend race on `sessionEpoch`) promoted to L-13.3.9 (one-shot-per-`Connected`-epoch latch). Boolean injection over provider promoted to L-13.3.8. Typed `SyntheticTriggerResult` over Boolean return promoted to L-13.3.10.
- **Tests/adversarial:** Acceptance matrix delivered (~1450 words, source-grounded against PR #330 head `6f49cd89` and master HEAD `98ee7e09`). Cites real markers: `mode_2_signature_matched action=fast_path`, `sticky_armed`, `ws_reconnect_quiesced`, `ws_recovery_probe_granted`, `ws_reconnect_resumed`, `sticky_cleared proof=ws_alive_60s`, `ws_reconnect_open proof=ws_alive_60s`. Negative-presence checks for the parallel-test-only-path prohibition. Mode-2 window pinned `MODE_2_MIN_DURATION_MS=25000` / `MAX=65000` from `RestStateMachine.kt:1732-1747`. Promoted to L-13.3.11 (matrix is test floor, not ceiling).
- **Security:** L1 SAFE WITH CONDITIONS — **two BLOCKERS**: (B-1) ProGuard wildcard `-keep class phantom.core.transport.KtorRelayTransport { *; }` on master HEAD preserves `debugForceMode2Synthetic` in release APK; (B-2) raw `am broadcast` foreclosed, S6-style four-layer protected operator surface required. Both promoted to L-13.3.6 / L-13.3.7. Five non-blockers (aggregate-counter `closeOrigin` loss, no one-shot semantics, check-then-trySend race, info-disclosure low-risk, CI-compromise bounded).

**Per §13.5 forward-pointer:** a separate **L1 implementation mini-lock PR** opens AFTER this closure PR merges. The mini-lock carries forward locks L-13.3.1 through L-13.3.11, picks the S6-style operator-surface concrete shape, specifies the typed `SyntheticTriggerResult` enum, binds to the ProGuard narrowing precondition (either stack on PR #330's narrowing or include equivalent in L1 track), and adopts the acceptance matrix at `C:\temp\quiescence-h-me-council-2026-06-29\tests.md` as the test floor. The mini-lock is NOT scoped by this closure. The L1 implementation PR opens only after the mini-lock merges.

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 **CLOSED with verdict H-ME**. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged — its B1 gate from `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §11 closes only when **MC PASS + MB PASS** land on record per L-13.3.1. DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §11 / §12 unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — closure verdict + §13 + status flip (~190 LOC). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-h-me-closure`. Off master `98ee7e09`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator opens the L1 implementation mini-lock PR (separate docs PR) after this closure merges. Carries locks L-13.3.1 through L-13.3.11 as binding constraints. NOT auto-started.
- After mini-lock merges, the L1 implementation PR can open (code change). NOT auto-started.
- After L1 implementation merges AND the MC integration tests are in place, the controlled Wi-Fi smoke run can validate the end-to-end quiescence chain. NOT auto-started.

### 2026-06-29 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 N-3 progress — synthetic-trigger debug-flag design exercise

**Outcome:** Third instrument N-3 completed immediately after PR #347 squash `88cf810a`. Source-read + design sketch only; no code change; no operator devices touched; PR #330 untouched. New §12 appended to `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (~150 LOC).

**Mode 2 detection chain on master HEAD (the destination a synthetic trigger would feed):** two downstream consumers of a single upstream lifecycle event, dispatched SEQUENTIALLY in `WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher.dispatch(Ended)` — state-machine consumer first (line 55 `submitStateEvent`), telemetry consumer second (line 59 `feedDegradationDetector`). Shared upstream: `KtorRelayTransport` per-session `finally` block parses close-error via `PingTimeoutTextParser`, computes `okhttpPingTimeoutDetected`, emits `WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Ended(...)` into `_wsSessionLifecycle: Channel<WsSessionLifecycleEvent>` (line 1029-1040). Consumer A (state-machine actuation, R3.6): dispatcher line 55 → `submitStateEvent(toRestStateMachineEvent()) → RestStateMachine.onWsSessionEnded` → 3-condition signature check (`inboundFrames == 0 && okhttpPingTimeoutDetected && durationMs in MODE_2_MIN..MAX`) → if `mode2FastPathEnabled = true` → `transitionToRest("mode_2_fast_path")` + if `mode2StickyEnabled = true` → `armSticky()` → emits `REST_TRACE sticky_armed gen=N reason=mode_2_fast_path`. Consumer B (telemetry-only on master): dispatcher line 59 → `feedDegradationDetectorOnWsSessionEnded → WsDegradationDetector.recordAndEmit(Event.PingTimeout, kind)` → `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY` log lines (no action per the detector class KDoc line 59: "No `markSuspect` action. This detector only logs."). PR #330's quiescence chain hooks on top of `armSticky()`. Both `mode2FastPathEnabled` and `mode2StickyEnabled` are `Boolean` constructor parameters on `RestStateMachine` (commonMain); Android-side `AppContainer.kt:1348-1357` reads `phantom.android.BuildConfig.MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED == "1"` / `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED == "1"` and passes the Booleans down — commonMain code never reads `BuildConfig` directly.

**Five candidate injection levels (L0–L4) with per-level honesty profile:**

- **L0 wire-level:** 100% production-path coverage. Practically infeasible without server coordination OR deeply-invasive ping-watchdog hook (which would itself be a parallel test-only path inside `KtorRelayTransport`).
- **L1 lifecycle event channel (`_wsSessionLifecycle.trySend(WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Ended(...))`):** HIGH coverage. Bypasses only OkHttp WS session + parser + finally-block assembly. Both Consumer A (state-machine actuation) and Consumer B (telemetry detector) downstream code runs unchanged. Gap-1 `PingTimeoutTextParser` bypassed (covered by `PingTimeoutTextParserTest` 13 cells on master). Gap-2 finally-block assembly bypassed (mitigated by honesty constraint: synthetic must use same constructor, same field shape, no test-only overrides). Gap-3 no real WS active (mitigated: synthetic refuses to fire unless `state == Connected` with valid `sessionEpoch`).
- **L2 state-machine entry (`restStateMachine.submit(Event.WsSessionEnded(...))`):** MEDIUM. Bypasses Consumer B (no `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY` line). Consumer A signature check + sticky arming still emit honestly.
- **L3 state-machine internal (`armSticky()` direct):** LOW. Skips signature check + BuildConfig gate logic. Closer to parallel test-only path.
- **L4 gate-level direct (force `Quiesced` state):** VERY LOW. Maximum false-confidence. Only on PR #330 anyway.

**Verdict per §5 framing** ("can the flag be designed so the synthetic trigger exercises the SAME code path the field would exercise on a real Mode 2 episode, without becoming a parallel test-only code path that diverges from production?"): **L1 is the cleanest candidate; L2 acceptable for state-machine-only validation but loses Consumer B (telemetry detector) coverage; L3 / L4 ruled out by the §5 prohibition on parallel test-only paths; L0 ruled out by infeasibility on master HEAD.**

**Six load-bearing honesty constraints** for an L1 design (if a future methodology chose it): (1) same constructor, no field overrides; (2) `closeOrigin="synthetic"` discipline as telemetry tell; (3) no parallel branch in dispatcher/state-machine on closeOrigin; (4) BuildConfig gates remain orthogonal — `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION` makes the event happen, does NOT make actuation happen; (5) `Connected` precondition; (6) field-validation scope honesty — synthetic validates everything from `WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Ended` downstream, does NOT validate OkHttp ping watchdog firing on real radio death or parser regex against actual OkHttp phrase (latter has its own coverage on master).

**Sketch of §12.4 L1 surface** (NOT a proposal — §5 design-exercise output only) — must respect commonMain / Android isolation rule (shared code cannot see `phantom.android.BuildConfig`; established pattern at `AppContainer.kt:1348-1357` reads on Android side and injects Boolean to shared constructor): one new Android-side BuildConfig flag `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION` defaulting `"0"` in release block (mirroring existing `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` / `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` / `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` pattern with companion `Mode2DebugForceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest` in `androidUnitTest`); one new constructor parameter on `KtorRelayTransport` — `debugForceMode2Enabled: Boolean = false` (or `debugForceMode2Provider: () -> Boolean = { false }` if lazy re-evaluation needed). AppContainer reads the BuildConfig literal on the Android side and injects the resulting Boolean / provider down. One new `internal fun debugForceMode2Synthetic(durationMs: Long): Boolean` method on `KtorRelayTransport` (`internal` only, no `public` alias), gated at the top by the injected Boolean/provider; refuses if `_state.value !is TransportState.Connected`; refuses if `durationMs` lies outside `MODE_2_MIN_DURATION_MS..MODE_2_MAX_DURATION_MS`; builds the synthetic event satisfying the signature check (`inboundFrames = 0, okhttpPingTimeoutDetected = true, closeOrigin = "synthetic", closeError = "DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION", pendingAcksAtClose = 0, sessionEpoch = current epoch`); calls `_wsSessionLifecycle.trySend(WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Ended(...))` and returns the success Boolean; one operator-facing trigger surface on the Android side (debug menu OR `am broadcast` intent handler registered in AndroidManifest debug block — design left open at sketch level).

Per §9 hand-off rule: N-3 progress note does NOT propose H-MB, H-ME, or any combination methodology. N-3 does NOT decide whether L1 is the right shape (presupposes methodology choice). N-3 does NOT propose code (the §12.4 sketch is design-exercise output, NOT a scope-lock). N-3 does NOT decide whether PR #330's gate accepts the L1-injected signal cleanly (out of "master HEAD" source-read scope).

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 still Open. N-1 + N-2 + N-3 instruments complete. N-4 / N-5 candidates remain; operator chooses (or parks per §7 P-2). RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §11 / §12 unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — N-3 progress amendment on `quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (~150 LOC). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-n3-synthetic-trigger`. Off master `88cf810a`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator decides next instrument (or parks). Remaining candidates per §5: N-4 third-network-class survey / N-5 release-gate review against PR #330's user population. The recon does NOT recommend any of them.
- If the operator parks further N-x work, the recon parks per §7 P-2 with the N-1 + N-2 + N-3 evidence on record.
- Methodology recommendation is NOT permitted in any N-x progress note per §9. The recon's closure verdict comes after instrument evidence supports one of §6's acceptance gates.

### 2026-06-29 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 N-2 progress — fake-transport surface review on master HEAD

**Outcome:** Second instrument N-2 completed immediately after PR #346 squash `e568d97b`. Source-read only; no operator devices touched; PR #330 untouched. New §11 appended to `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (~110 LOC) catalogues **16 fake-transport test doubles + 3 auxiliary doubles** on master HEAD and assesses each against the five quiescence-surface dimensions named in §5 (Mode 2 detector input signals, sticky window timing, recovery probe outcome, 60s probation / `ws_alive_60s` proof, self-reentry / dup / loss).

Catalogue (16 fake-transport doubles + 3 auxiliary): 11 `RestFallbackTransport` doubles across 8 test files (`RestFallbackOrchestratorTest`, `RestFallbackOrchestratorPollLoopTest`, `WsActivePollJobLifecycleTest`, `AckInboundAndAdvanceCursorTest`, `BodyTimeoutContractTest`, `RestFallbackOrchestratorBreakerTest` × 2, `RestFallbackOrchestratorC6Test`, `RestFallbackOrchestratorVerifyAndPostureTest` × 3); 2 `RelayTransport` doubles (`FakeRelayTransportTest`, `DefaultMessagingServiceTest`); 3 `PreKeyPublishHttpTransport` doubles (`PreKeyApiClientTest`, `PreKeyPublishReliabilityTest`, `PreKeyPublishResnapshotTest`); plus 3 auxiliary (`FakeMediaAuthTokenProvider`, `CapturingTransportManagerLog`, `FakeLastSeenSeqRepository`).

Per-dimension fidelity verdict on master HEAD — two honest counts (both apply):

- **Per §5 framing (5 dimensions): 3 NOT MODELLED / 1 PARTIAL but bypasses fakes / 1 MIXED.**
  - NOT MODELLED (3 of 5): Mode 2 detector input signals (no `RelayTransport` fake emits `WsSessionLifecycleEvent` — the interface doesn't surface lifecycle events at all). Sticky window timing (gate absent on master). Recovery probe outcome (gate absent).
  - PARTIAL but bypasses fakes (1 of 5): 60s probation / `ws_alive_60s` proof. `RestStateMachineTest` exercises the numeric on master via controllable `now` driven directly into the production state machine — no fake transport is in the loop. The gate-side invocation of the same numeric is absent.
  - MIXED (1 of 5): self-reentry / dup / loss — three sub-surfaces with distinct fidelity. WS-side self-reentry NOT MODELLED. WS-side gate-coordinated dup / loss NOT MODELLED (gate absent). REST-side dup / loss FAITHFULLY MODELLED (`Idempotency-Key` plumbing genuinely surfaced; `RestInboundDeduplicator` `Emit / SkipNoAck / ReAck` discipline well-covered; end-to-end FIFO covered via internal test seams on production `KtorRelayTransport`, no fake transport involved).
- **Per §11.3 row-level table (7 rows splitting the MIXED dimension): 5 NOT MODELLED / 1 PARTIAL / 1 FAITHFULLY MODELLED.**

Structural finding (§11.4): master HEAD fakes are **interface-shaped, not lifecycle-shaped**. Each component is unit-test-scaffolded in isolation (orchestrator via fake, state machine via controllable `now`, detector via virtual state provider). No fake on master HEAD emits the cross-component signals a quiescence-chain integration validation would have to observe. The closest existing lifecycle-shaped pattern is `WsLifecycleCollectorSideEffectsTest` (android, 3 tests) which bypasses transports entirely and drives `WsSessionLifecycleEvent.Ended → toLegacyEndedEvent → feedDegradationDetectorOnWsSessionEnded` against a real `WsDegradationDetector` — but it stops at the detector verdict and does not exercise downstream gate behaviour (because the gate does not exist on master HEAD).

Per §9 hand-off rule: N-2 progress note does NOT propose a methodology. N-2 does NOT decide whether the fakes could be extended into a gate-validating shape (that question presupposes a methodology choice). N-2 does NOT decide whether PR #330's own added test files provide an integration-shaped infrastructure (those are on PR #330's branch only and out of "master HEAD" scope).

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 still Open. N-1 + N-2 instruments complete. N-3 / N-4 / N-5 candidates remain — operator chooses which (if any) to run next. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §11 / §12 unchanged.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — N-2 progress amendment on `quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (~110 LOC). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-n2-fake-surface`. Off master `e568d97b`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator decides next instrument (or parks). Candidates per §5: N-3 synthetic-trigger debug-flag design exercise / N-4 third-network-class survey / N-5 release-gate review against PR #330's user population. The recon does NOT recommend any of them.
- If the operator parks further N-x work, the recon parks per §7 P-2 with the N-1 + N-2 evidence on record.
- Methodology recommendation is NOT permitted in any N-x progress note per §9. The recon's closure verdict comes after instrument evidence supports one of §6's acceptance gates.

### 2026-06-29 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 N-1 progress — existing-test inventory on master HEAD

**Outcome:** First instrument N-1 completed. Source-read only; no operator devices touched; PR #330 untouched. New §10 appended to `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (`+106 LOC`) catalogues 26 relevant test files across `shared/core/transport/src/commonTest` and `apps/android/src/androidUnitTest` and maps per-Phase-B-hypothesis coverage on master HEAD.

Inventory summary: **0 of 6 hypotheses FULL-COVERED on master HEAD. 3 of 6 PARTIAL** (H-330-Preserves-REST, H-330-Probe-Lives-60s, H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups — related invariants well-covered in `RestStateMachineTest` / `RestFallbackOrchestratorBreakerTest` / `KtorRelayTransportFifoTest` / `KtorRelayTransportPendingOutboundTest` / `RestInboundDeduplicatorTest` / `AckInboundAndAdvanceCursorTest` / `BodyTimeoutContractTest`, but the gate-coordinated quiescence-window flow is not exercised). **3 of 6 NOT-COVERED** (H-330-Quiesces-Storm, H-330-Single-Probe-Per-RouteChange, H-330-No-Self-Reentry — the load-bearing `WsReconnectGate.kt` component is ABSENT on master; it is introduced by PR #330 as a 447-LOC new file containing the `Open / Quiesced / ProbeAvailable / ProbeClaimed / CandidateProving` state machine).

Side-finding flagged but explicitly OUT OF SCOPE per §5 framing "master HEAD": PR #330 adds eight test files of its own (`WsReconnectGateTest` 1172 LOC, `HybridRelayTransportIntegrationTest20` 686 LOC, `TransportRewalkCoordinatorTransactionTest` 667 LOC, `KtorRelayTransportDisconnectAndJoinTest` 848 LOC, `KtorRelayTransportRunReconnectLoopTest` 480 LOC, `RestFallbackOrchestratorQuiescenceWiringTest` 184 LOC, `ReconnectQuiescenceReleaseBuildConfigPinTest` 117 LOC, `KtorRelayTransportInternalTestSeams` 153 LOC). Whether those tests honestly cover the six hypotheses at the state-machine / integration level is a separate question about PR #330's CI — not N-1's question, not opened here.

Per §9 hand-off rule: N-1 progress note does NOT propose a methodology. N-1 does NOT decide H-MC's feasibility; that is N-2's job (fake-transport surface review). N-2 is operator-scheduled; do NOT auto-start.

**Track status:** QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 still Open. N-1 first instrument complete. N-2 next when operator schedules. RC PR #330 Draft / HOLD unchanged. DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 unchanged; §11 / §12 amendment landed in PR #343 / PR #344 still load-bearing.

**Key PRs:**

- **#TBD (this docs PR)** — N-1 progress amendment on `quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` (+106 LOC). Branch `docs/quiescence-validation-n1-inventory`. Off master `aab66577`.

**Follow-ups:**

- Operator: schedule N-2 (fake-transport surface review) when ready. Pure source-read; no operator devices.
- N-2 reads `FakeRelayTransport`, the `RestFallbackTransport` test doubles, `BodyTimeoutTestTransport`, `FakePreKeyPublishHttpTransport`, etc. and assesses whether each faithfully models the surface PR #330's quiescence depends on (Mode 2 detector input signals, sticky window timing, recovery probe outcome).
- N-2's output is a docs-only progress amendment on this same track-doc.
- Methodology recommendation is NOT permitted in any N-x progress note per §9. The recon's closure verdict comes after the instruments produce evidence sufficient to support one of the §6 acceptance gates.

### 2026-06-28 · QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1 mini-lock opened — discriminate among five candidate methodologies (+ release-gate amendment fallback) for honestly closing B1

**Outcome:** Operator greenlit the methodology recon flagged as forward-pointer in `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §12 K-6 outcome. New track-doc at `docs/tracks/quiescence-validation-methodology-recon1.md` opens a facts-first recon to discriminate among candidate methodologies for field-validating PR #330's quiescence chain (`sticky → quiesced → probe → ws_alive_60s recovery`) when neither Wi-Fi (no Mode 2 reproduction) nor Tele2 LTE (broken REST fallback substrate per TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 §11 closure) can do the job alone.

The recon does NOT propose a methodology; it discriminates among candidates and forwards a chosen path back to DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 for execution.

**Six candidate methodologies (H-MA through H-MF):**

- H-MA — third network class that reproduces Mode 2 AND keeps REST alive (different LTE carrier, tethered Wi-Fi through mobile hotspot, degraded-RSSI Wi-Fi)
- H-MB — synthetic in-app trigger via debug-only build flag (e.g., `DEBUG_FORCE_MODE_2_DETECTION="1"`) that injects "Mode 2 detected" state; must hit the SAME production code path the field would hit, not a parallel test-only path
- H-MC — state-machine / integration validation against existing fake-transport infrastructure (`RestStateMachineTest.kt`, `RestFallbackOrchestratorBreakerTest.kt`, `WsActivePollJobLifecycleTest.kt`, `RestFallbackOrchestratorPollLoopTest.kt`); discriminates whether the fakes faithfully model the field surface or diverge in load-bearing ways
- H-MD — combination MC + MA (state-machine primary, one field run on a network class where Mode 2 fires AND REST survives)
- H-ME — combination MC + MB (state-machine primary, synthetic in-app trigger as field-shaped check)
- H-MF — release-gate amendment fallback (not strictly a validation methodology; accept the validation gap and re-scope §11's release / rollout gate to Wi-Fi-only ship). Listed only because it is the realistic alternative if H-MA through H-ME all turn out to be infeasible.

**Five candidate instruments (N-1 through N-5), explicitly NOT pre-committed in advance:**

- N-1 existing-test inventory (cheap source-read; per-hypothesis test-coverage status on master HEAD)
- N-2 fake-transport surface review (cheap source-read; whether existing fakes honestly model the field surface)
- N-3 synthetic-trigger debug-flag design exercise (design-only feasibility note)
- N-4 third-network-class survey (per-candidate go / no-go table)
- N-5 release-gate review against PR #330's user-population network-class distribution

Natural order: N-1 + N-2 first (cheapest), then N-3 / N-4 / N-5 driven by what N-1 + N-2 surface.

**Six acceptance gates** (one per closure verdict: MC-sufficient / MD / ME / MA-only / MB-only / MF release-gate amendment) plus inconclusive escalation to Council.

**Three Park conditions** (all methodologies fail feasibility / honesty bar; operator unavailable; separate fix-track lands that changes the substrate).

**Out-of-scope explicit:** no code change in this recon; no fix scope-lock; specifically NOT pre-locked — extending B1's hypothesis set, weakening §11's release / rollout gate from inside this recon, dropping any of the six Phase B hypotheses, accepting "letter met / spirit not" verdicts as B1-PASS. PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD throughout. No commit to PR #330's branch.

**Follow-ups:** N-1 (existing-test inventory) runs as the first deliverable when the operator schedules it. RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD; its gating now includes the closure of this recon plus the §11 release / rollout gate, in series.

### 2026-06-28 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §12 K-6 outcome — Wi-Fi non-regression PASS / quiescence NOT EXERCISED — methodology recon forward-pointer

**Outcome:** Operator-executed K-6 on 2026-06-28: Tecno Wi-Fi + emu Wi-Fi pair (~30 min), VPN OFF, fix-candidate APK SHA-256 `65ebaebf3a3f72e0eb8bc4bf381bcc85f72482370b0c401ad36a8d6f99803e35` built from PR #330 head `6f49cd89` with three RC release flags forced to `"1"` via env vars at build time (verified in `BuildConfig.java`). NO commits made to PR #330's branch.

**New verdict class — B1 non-regression PASS / quiescence NOT EXERCISED.** §11 anticipated B1-PASS / B1-PARTIAL / B1-FAIL but not "all six hypotheses meet the letter while the spirit (mechanism actually tested) was not met". K-6 hypothesis matrix: 1 PASS (H-330-No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups), 4 NOT EXERCISED (H-330-Quiesces-Storm, H-330-Single-Probe-Per-RouteChange, H-330-Probe-Lives-60s in quiescence context, H-330-No-Self-Reentry), 1 VACUOUSLY PASS (H-330-Preserves-REST — present REST events but not stress-tested by a quiescence window). Mode 2 detector did not fire on Wi-Fi (consistent with K-1's F-Mode1 carry-forward; the detector targets the Mode 2 signature specifically per PR #328's R3.6 design). Five `mode_switched ... reason=ws_alive_60s` events observed (Tecno 4 + emu 1) but each was a R3.6 sticky-per-route `WsCandidate → WS_ACTIVE` transition WITHOUT preceding `sticky_armed` — these are NOT quiescence-recovery probes despite the matching log field name.

**What K-6 DID establish:** PR #330 with three flags `"1"` does not regress Wi-Fi delivery; messages flowed in both directions; zero `relay_send_return ok=false`; reconnect ratios (Tecno 33/16 = 2.06×, emu 33/16 = 2.06×) unchanged vs K-1 baseline (2.0× both); Sprint 2b-C inbound_repair_ok promotion=true works on Wi-Fi (7 `pending_fallback_fail` per side all followed by successful `inbound_repair_ok promotion=true`, zero `DECRYPT_TRACE fail_mac`, zero `OpkNotFound`, zero `inbound_repair_fail`, zero `action=hold` — positive data point against the K-2 LTE side-finding's "Sprint 2b-C might regress" worry).

**What K-6 did NOT establish:** core PR #330 quiescence chain (`sticky → probe → ws_alive_60s recovery`) NOT field-validated. Four NOT-EXERCISED hypotheses cover the load-bearing claims of PR #330's mini-lock. PR #330 is NOT closer to ship-readiness on the strength of K-6 alone. The §11 release / rollout gate stays in force.

**Phase B status after K-6:**

- B1 acceptance gate: NOT closed. K-6 meets §11's letter (no hypothesis FAILED) but not its spirit (mechanism actually tested). A future deliverable that exercises the quiescence chain is required.
- K-3 (emu Wi-Fi-only) remains NOT promoted.
- PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD; gating unchanged.

**Forward-pointer — methodology question (NOT scoped here, NOT a track opened by this PR):** how to validate the quiescence mechanism when Wi-Fi does not reproduce Mode 2 (no symptom) AND Tele2 LTE breaks the REST fallback substrate (no working venue). Three candidate paths for operator decision: (a) find a third network class that reproduces Mode 2 AND keeps REST alive (different LTE carrier, tethered Wi-Fi through mobile hotspot, degraded-RSSI Wi-Fi); (b) synthetic / instrumentation-only triggers (carries false-confidence risk); (c) state-machine / integration-level validation against a fake transport that scripts the Mode 2 surface (carries model-vs-field divergence risk). A separate facts-first recon — working name `QUIESCENCE-VALIDATION-METHODOLOGY-RECON1` — is the natural place to discriminate, but it is NOT opened by this PR; it is a forward-pointer for the operator's next decision.

**Side-findings preserved (NOT actioned here):**

- Operator's QR-add → reverse-add warm-up flow was the same paired-bootstrap pattern as K-1; not a scenario deviation.
- Receiver-side decrypt counts (Tecno 6, emu 10) lower than expected for 4 × 2 = 8 scheduled messages because the analysis script's regex counted only `DECRYPT_TRACE ok` and missed `inbound_repair_ok` events (which carry plaintext bytes too). Future K-runs should add `inbound_repair_ok` to the receiver-side delivery count to avoid under-counting deliveries that took the repair path.

**Follow-ups:** the parent recon stays open with B1 unresolved. The methodology recon opens (if ever) on a separate operator-greenlit mini-lock, NOT auto-opened by this PR. RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD; gating unchanged.

### 2026-06-28 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 §11 Phase B amendment — B1 Wi-Fi mechanical validation + B2 separate Tele2 LTE delivery-blocker track + explicit release / rollout gate

**Outcome:** Operator decision after TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 closure (PR #342 squash `4302f56d`): instead of choosing among the three candidate paths the recon forwarded (re-scope Phase B to Wi-Fi only / open separate fix-track first / accept LTE limitation), the operator picked a fourth refinement that splits Phase B explicitly. **B1 = Wi-Fi mechanical validation of PR #330's quiescence contract. B2 = separate Tele2 LTE delivery-blocker track to be opened on its own terms. Release / rollout gate: PR #330 does NOT ship to LTE users on B1-PASS alone.**

The reformulation matters because the bare "accept LTE limitation" framing risked reading as product-level acceptance that PR #330 ships when Wi-Fi passes. The B1 / B2 split is the more honest framing: validating the quiescence mechanism on Wi-Fi is one deliverable; the LTE delivery surface remains a release blocker on its own terms.

**B1 scope (mechanical validation, not ship-readiness):**

- Build a fix-candidate APK from PR #330 head (currently `6f49cd89`) with the three RC release flags forced to `"1"`: `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED`, `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED`, `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED`. K-5 from original mini-lock §5; build-time operation only, NO commits to PR #330's branch.
- One Tecno session on Wi-Fi (~30 min) with the fix-candidate APK, paired with the emu on Wi-Fi. Compare against K-1 Wi-Fi baseline (already captured 2026-06-27).
- B1-PASS = all six Phase B hypotheses hold (H-330-Quiesces-Storm / Preserves-REST / Single-Probe-Per-RouteChange / Probe-Lives-60s / No-Self-Reentry / No-Message-Loss-Or-Dups). This confirms the quiescence mechanism is mechanically correct on Wi-Fi; it does NOT confirm PR #330 ship-readiness.
- K-3 (emu Wi-Fi) NOT promoted as B1 prerequisite — does not add discrimination value for the quiescence-mechanism check.

**B2 scope (NOT yet opened — forward-pointer only):**

- Tele2 LTE end-to-end delivery is a separate problem governed by `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13 (long-connection-uplink) and TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 §11 closure (downlink long-poll body loss on the same network class).
- B2 mini-lock opens on its own when the operator schedules it. Candidate scope shapes from the TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 closure forward-pointer (short-poll mode on LTE / decoupling `callTimeout` from `readTimeout` / server-side keep-alive byte trickle / alternative relay endpoint or transport on LTE-detected paths) become candidate hypotheses for B2's §4 if opened, NOT promotion as fix from this recon.

**Release / rollout gate (load-bearing):**

- PR #330 does NOT ship to LTE users on B1-PASS alone. B1-PASS confirms mechanism mechanical correctness on Wi-Fi; it does NOT confirm message delivery on Tele2 LTE because the REST fallback substrate is structurally broken on that network class per carry-forward evidence.
- Two paths to LTE rollout (NOT promoted from this recon — operator decision after B1 closes): (i) B2 closes with a fix-track verdict and a B2-validated APK demonstrates Tele2 LTE end-to-end delivery in a separate field run; OR (ii) an alternative transport for the LTE class lands separately (Reality, alternative relay endpoint, relay-side hold-policy change) and demonstrates working LTE delivery. Either path requires affirmative evidence of working LTE delivery.

**Follow-ups:** B1 K-5 APK build + K-6 Tecno Wi-Fi session is the next operator-scheduled deliverable. B2 mini-lock opens separately when the operator schedules it. RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD throughout — its gating is now B1 acceptance gate PLUS the release/rollout gate (B2 closure OR alternative LTE transport with affirmative evidence).

### 2026-06-28 · TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 M-1 + M-5 progress + closure verdict (Option 2) — Phase B architectural-question forward-pointer

**Outcome:** Two-PR sequence on 2026-06-28. PR #341 (M-1 + M-5 combined progress note, two-round review) merged squash `51e72e03`; this PR adds §11 closure verdict per the operator-chosen Option 2 (close on M-1 + M-5 + carry-forward correlation with `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13 T2 outcome, without running M-2 packet capture). Recon closes with two hypotheses supported (H-NetworkSideCancellation, H-Tele2LTESpecific) but explicitly NOT packet-confirmed, and three forward-pointer paths for the parent `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` Phase B blocker that the operator now decides among.

**M-1 + M-5 findings (re-read of K-2 corpus + source-code read, no field re-run):**

- All 11 `op=poll callFailed exception=InterruptedIOException` events on Tecno carry `totalMs` in `35002-35006 ms` (4 ms spread; distribution: 1 × 35002, 1 × 35004, 5 × 35005, 4 × 35006). Tightly clustered at the 35 s budget ceiling — mechanistically incompatible with a WS-state-driven cancellation that would produce variable elapsed times.
- 12 `op=poll responseHeadersEnd status=200` events appear in the corpus; **zero `op=poll responseBodyEnd` events** across the full 30 minutes. Polls received headers + partial body chunks (up to `cumulative_bytes=3456` of ~4608 expected padded Round 14 response), then the remaining bytes never arrived.
- Source-read at master HEAD `b3943641`: `35 s = (pollHoldSecs=30 + POLL_HOLD_SAFETY_MARGIN_SECS=5) × 1000 ms` defined at `RestFallbackOrchestrator.kt::computeLongPollReadTimeoutMs` line 3689, threaded into OkHttp `callTimeout` via `AndroidNativeOkHttpRestFallbackTransport.kt`. The `InterruptedIOException` is the OkHttp call-timeout firing at its budgeted ceiling, NOT an orchestrator-internal interrupt.
- Source-read: WS deliver-in path (`HybridRelayTransport.kt::startWsPassthroughCollectors` line 446) launches `scope.launch { wsTransport.incoming.collect { ... _incoming.emit(deliver) ... } }` independent of breaker state. When the breaker is open, only `op=poll` is skipped; WS frames continue to flow through.

**Hypothesis matrix at closure:**

- **H-OrchestratorCancellation: REFUTED** — fixed-budget 35 s timeout is OkHttp `callTimeout`, not WS-state-driven interrupt.
- **H-NetworkSideCancellation: SUPPORTED via M-1 + M-5 + T2 carry-forward, NOT packet-confirmed.** Direction matches `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13 ("long-held connection on Tele2 LTE uplink is structurally untrustworthy") applied to downlink. Corpus alone cannot fully exclude relay-side response truncation under load, HTTP/2 stream backpressure, or TLS-layer renegotiation race. M-2 packet capture (NOT run per operator decision) would be required to conclusively pin to TCP-layer cuts vs the listed alternatives.
- **H-BreakerCooldownTooAggressive: DEMOTED — not the root cause.** Breaker correctly counts genuine failures; cooldown ramp is downstream artefact.
- **H-BreakerOpenBlocksInboundDispatch: REFUTED** at M-5 source-read level. WS deliver-in not gated by breaker.
- **H-Tele2LTESpecific: SUPPORTED.** Single-variable K-1 Wi-Fi vs K-2 Tele2 LTE comparison + `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13 corroboration. Not confirmed against other LTE carriers — verdict bounded to "this surface is observable on Tele2 LTE".
- **H-OkHttpInterruptionRace: REFUTED.** `InterruptedIOException` is OkHttp's stock `callTimeout` surface.

**Net architectural picture:** K-2 inbound-delivery gap on Tecno is caused by two independent failures on the same network class, both rooted below the application layer: (1) Tele2 LTE long-held downlink connection drops body bytes before response completes (same family as T2 uplink finding, different direction); (2) Tele2 LTE Direct WSS dies in Mode 2 pp0 rhythm. Neither failure is in the application code at master HEAD. The R3.6 breaker policy is correctly observing the REST failure pattern; the WS deliver-in path is correctly wired and would deliver if WS sessions became alive.

**Forward-pointer for parent `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` Phase B (NOT this recon's scope):** the closure does NOT resolve the parent's Phase B blocker. The architectural question is now explicit: does PR #330's quiescence contract have a defensible meaning on a network class where REST fallback cannot complete long-poll bodies? Three candidate paths for the operator to decide on the parent recon (NOT promoted here): (a) re-scope Phase B to Wi-Fi only with explicit honesty about Tele2 LTE governance by `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13; (b) open a separate fix-track for the long-held-connection problem before Phase B continues; (c) accept the LTE limitation and validate Phase B on Wi-Fi as best-available evidence. Candidate fix-shape sets (NOT promoted): short-poll mode on LTE, decoupling `callTimeout` from `readTimeout` in long-poll path, server-side keep-alive byte trickle to defeat NAT teardown, switching to a different relay endpoint or transport on LTE-detected paths.

**Side-findings preserved (NOT actioned by this closure):**

- Round 14 padded poll body (~4608 bytes) sits close to the T2 cumulative-bytes threshold class (~5 KB observed cutoff per `rc-direct-stability1.md` §13). Could be coincidence; could be that the same byte-budget mechanism applies to long-poll responses. Reference for any future scope-lock on cumulative-bytes.
- `AndroidNativeOkHttpRestFallbackTransport.kt:330` couples `callTimeout` and `readTimeout` to the same 35 s budget on long-poll enabled paths. A future fix-track may consider decoupling these.
- K-2 Emu-side Sprint 2b-C `OpkNotFound` / `fail_mac` on 2 of 3 messages — single observation, NOT scoped here. If reproduces, a separate `SPRINT-2B-C-INBOUND-REPAIR-REGRESSION-RECON` opens.

**Follow-ups:** the parent `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` track-doc gets a corresponding amendment in a separate follow-up docs PR (scope of THIS PR is the recon closure only). RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD throughout — its gating now becomes whichever of the three architectural-question paths the operator chooses for the parent recon.

### 2026-06-27 · DIRECT-WSS-MODE2-RECON1 Phase A progress (K-1 clean + K-2 not-clean) + TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 mini-lock opened — Phase B blocked

**Outcome:** Operator ran K-1 (Tecno Wi-Fi) and K-2 (Tecno Tele2 LTE) on master HEAD `5934310e` debug APK (SHA `3d3317bd...`). K-1 captured a clean baseline; K-2 captured the target Direct WSS Mode 2 shape but ALSO surfaced a separate REST-fallback failure on Tele2 LTE that refutes the parent recon's `H-REST-Survives` hypothesis on that network class. A new facts-first recon track opens to discriminate the REST breaker root cause before Phase B / RC PR #330 validation can proceed.

**K-1 — Tecno Wi-Fi (CLEAN baseline):**

- 21 WSS sessions on each device (Tecno + emu both Wi-Fi). Lifetime median ~136 s, 7 successful ping/pongs in 18/21 (Tecno) and 17/21 (emu) sessions. Outlier shape (76 s / 91 s / 121 s with 3 / 4 / 6 pongs) on both devices in the same sessions. `F-Mode1` baseline re-confirmed on master HEAD with a slight cadence shift vs the historical ~150 s × 8 pongs in `rc-direct-stability1.md` §1.
- REST poll + send + inbound_deliver: 90 events on Tecno, 88 events on emu. `relay_send_return ok=false = 0` on both. Delivery worked.
- Cross-device synchronisation `±2-3 s` per session-number side-finding noted; not promoted to a hypothesis.
- Evidence files preserved at `C:\temp\direct-wss-mode2-k1-tecno-wifi\` with SHA-256 documented in parent track-doc §10.

**K-2 — Tecno Tele2 LTE (NOT clean — Direct WSS captured BUT REST fallback failed):**

- Tecno on Tele2 LTE (Wi-Fi disabled), emu on Mac's Wi-Fi, VPN OFF throughout.
- Tecno: **21 WSS sessions, ALL ~31 s, ALL 0 successful ping/pongs.** Textbook `F-Mode2 pp0` shape from `rc-direct-stability1.md` §1 re-confirmed cleanly. `WebSocket connect` count 54 (~2.5× sessions worth of reconnect storm).
- Tecno REST surface: **`H-REST-Survives` REFUTED on Tele2 LTE.** 11 `op=poll callFailed exception=InterruptedIOException` events. R3.6 sticky-recovery breaker cooldown ramped fully: `5 s → 10 s → 20 s → 40 s → 80 s → 120 s → 120 s` over ~5 minutes (7 `breaker_open ConsecutiveRestFailures` events). After breaker open, `poll_call_skipped reason=breaker_open_ConsecutiveRestFailures` events dominate the rest of the 30 min. **Zero `inbound_deliver` / `DECRYPT_TRACE` / `poll_received` events on Tecno across the entire session** — no messages received by Tecno after the breaker opened.
- Emu side: 7 WSS sessions ~121 s × 6 pongs (Mac Wi-Fi rhythm). Bootstrap message `1efed06e` decrypted OK; 2 subsequent messages from Tecno (`f8b8bff8` + `5f86fce8`) hit `inbound_repair_fail errorClass=OpkNotFound action=fall_through_to_hold` → `fail_mac action=hold`. Same Sprint 2b-C territory as the prekey-debounce-race fix and Sprint 2b-A/B/C work. **Side-finding ONLY** — single observation, NOT scoped into TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 and NOT re-opening Sprint 2b-C from this PR.
- Evidence files preserved at `~/Downloads/direct-wss-mode2-k2-tecno-lte/` with SHA-256 documented in parent track-doc §10.
- Analysis-script bug noted: the `DELIVERY OK` PRELIMINARY CLASSIFICATION label is misleading because the script counted only `relay_send_return ok=false` (sender-side). Future K-runs need to also count receiver-side `inbound_deliver` / `DECRYPT_TRACE` / `fail_mac` / `breaker_open` to avoid the same false-positive classification.

**TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 mini-lock (`docs/tracks/tele2-lte-rest-breaker-recon1.md`):**

Discriminate the root cause of the Tecno Tele2 LTE REST-poll failure observed in K-2. Four concrete questions: source of `InterruptedIOException`, why breaker cooldown ramps to 120 s ceiling in ~5 minutes, whether breaker-open state itself halts inbound dispatch, whether the failure is Tele2-specific. Six hypotheses (H-OrchestratorCancellation, H-NetworkSideCancellation, H-BreakerCooldownTooAggressive, H-BreakerOpenBlocksInboundDispatch, H-Tele2LTESpecific, H-OkHttpInterruptionRace). Five candidate instruments M-1 through M-5 explicitly NOT pre-committed in advance; natural order M-1 (re-read K-2 corpus, cheap) → M-5 (source read, cheap) → M-2 / M-3 / M-4 depending on evidence. Six acceptance-gate verdicts. Three Park conditions. Out-of-scope explicit: NO code change, NO PR #330 work, NO Mode 2 root cause re-open, NO Sprint 2b-C re-open, NO pre-locked fix shape.

**Phase B blocked.** Per `direct-wss-mode2-recon1.md` §6 rule that Phase B requires at least one CLEAN baseline (Direct WSS poor AND REST fallback delivering), K-2 does not unblock Phase B. K-1 Wi-Fi alone is not sufficient because PR #330's quiescence contract targets Tele2 LTE Mode 2 primarily — validating only on Wi-Fi would not exercise the contract's intended use case. K-3 (emu Wi-Fi) is NOT promoted as the next instrument either — it would produce a third baseline but would not address the Tele2 LTE REST-fallback question. The operator decision is to gate K-3 / Phase B / RC PR #330 work on the TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 outcome.

**Follow-ups:** M-1 (re-read of K-2 corpus for orchestrator-state-transition timeline) runs as the first deliverable when the operator schedules it. RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD throughout — its gating is now TELE2-LTE-REST-BREAKER-RECON1 closure, not the broader Direct WSS / Mode 2 track directly.



### 2026-06-27 · REST-SEND-CONNECTIVITY-RECON1 PARKED + VPN-TRANSPORT-COMPAT-RECON1 mini-lock opened

**Outcome:** After three I-2 reproduction attempts the REST-SEND-CONNECTIVITY-RECON1 track parks per §10 of `docs/tracks/rest-send-connectivity-recon1.md` WITHOUT a formal closure on any of the six hypotheses from §4. The target signature (`emu connectFailed` to `65.108.154.152:443` from `10.0.2.16`) did not reproduce in either clean attempt. A separate VPN compatibility recon opens in parallel to investigate the environment contamination that surfaced in attempt #1; the Direct WSS / Mode 2 stabilisation track remains the principal forward direction for transport reliability work, independent of either recon.

**Attempt summary:**

- **#1** (2026-06-26, ~8 min, Mac host VPN ON): INVALIDATED. Host VPN ↔ AVD QEMU NAT/DNS proxy interaction; emu logs showed `UnknownHostException: Unable to resolve host "relay.phntm.pro"` while the host system resolver kept working (`curl https://relay.phntm.pro/relay/poll` returned a clean `401`). Disabling VPN and restarting the emu cleanly restored end-to-end delivery. This spawned the follow-up VPN compatibility recon.
- **#2** (2026-06-26, ~39 min, VPN OFF): NOT TARGET REPRO. No emu / Tecno `connectFailed` to `65.108.154.152:443`. Host probe: 1581 data rows / 1564 SUCCESS / 17 `ec=28` fails — 2 isolated early at `18:41:25Z` and `18:41:40Z`, then a dense cluster of 15 fails in ~3 min spanning `18:47:36 → 18:50:47Z`. None co-incident with Phantom transport events. All Phantom messages delivered (`relay_send_return ok=true`). Direct WSS Mode 2 ping-timeout pattern visible on both devices as a separate signal. Evidence file `C:\temp\smoke-pr333-baseline-i2-v2.1\host-probe.tsv` SHA-256 `80153e4f702c1edee2aa8f9413407803b67a6e9858f40589009d1e24d342b12e`.
- **#3** (2026-06-26, ~39 min, VPN OFF): NOT TARGET REPRO. No emu / Tecno `connectFailed` to `65.108.154.152:443`. Host probe: 1672 data rows / 1650 SUCCESS / 22 fails (21 × `ec=28` connect-timeout + 1 × `ec=35` TLS handshake). Two notable burst clusters: 6 fails in ~53 s at `21:53:10 → 21:54:03Z` and 13 fails in ~138 s at `21:56:23 → 21:58:41Z`. None co-incident with Phantom transport events — devices were idle. UX-visible `prekey_fetch_result=timeout` once (8002 ms, 2 ms over the 8000 ms budget) followed by a 4 s retry succeeding; message delivered, not lost. Evidence file `C:\temp\smoke-pr333-baseline-i2-v2\host-probe.tsv` SHA-256 `15527f291e53b8738b291f92592991a907148a830e48a472307d4d57477fafea`.

**Disposition:** Parked per §7 P-1 ("symptom non-reproducible"). Strict P-1 would ask for three CLEAN attempts; two were achieved (#2 and #3). The operator decision is to park now rather than spend further session time on a target that is not reproducing, on the explicit understanding that the original 2026-06-26 evidence stays on file as a single-shot event and that any future regression on the same shape re-opens this recon — NOT the prekey-debounce track or any other track. The I-1 hypothesis matrix (H-A REFUTED, H-B strongly supported but not final-confirmed) stays valid as the last successful discrimination.

**Side-findings preserved (NOT actioned here):**

- **Host-side probe burst clusters on BOTH clean attempts** (strengthens a side-pattern none of the I-1 / I-2 rounds previously highlighted). Attempt #2: 15-fail cluster `18:47:36 → 18:50:47Z` (~3 min). Attempt #3: 6-fail cluster `21:53:10 → 21:54:03Z` (~53 s) AND a denser 13-fail cluster `21:56:23 → 21:58:41Z` (~138 s). None co-incident with Phantom transport events — devices were idle through both windows, so the corpus does NOT support promoting the pattern to a new hypothesis. If a future I-2 reproduction catches a co-incident emu burst PLUS a host-probe cluster of this shape, the standing I-1 hypothesis matrix (H-A REFUTED) would need re-examination. Both TSV files preserved on the operator workstation at the SHAs cited in the attempt rows above.
- **Direct WSS Mode 2 / ping-timeout pattern.** ~10 hits per side per attempt across #2 + #3. Same Mode 2 family the Direct WSS track owns; NOT scope here.
- **First-message UX delay (8 s prekey-fetch timeout + 4 s retry).** Same shape previously captured as a side-finding in the 2026-06-17 voice-smoke entry; transport correct, UX delay surface. Belongs to a future DWS-UX-class follow-up.

**VPN-TRANSPORT-COMPAT-RECON1 mini-lock (`docs/tracks/vpn-transport-compat-recon1.md`):**

- Goal: discriminate where VPN interaction breaks Phantom transport — DNS / TCP / TLS / application; AVD-only vs real-device-affected; Direct WSS only vs REST fallback also.
- Seven hypotheses (H-VPN-AVD-DNS, H-VPN-AVD-NAT, H-VPN-OS-DNS, H-VPN-HOST-ROUTING, H-VPN-REAL-DEVICE-AFFECTED, H-VPN-DWSS-ONLY, H-VPN-REST-ALSO).
- Five candidate diagnostic instruments (J-1 host VPN reachability matrix, J-2 AVD VPN reachability matrix, J-3 real-device under VPN, J-4 layer-bisection for the surviving hypothesis, J-5 Phantom path-by-path), explicitly NOT pre-committed in advance.
- Four acceptance-gate verdicts (AVD-only / real-device-affected / path-specific / REST-also). Two-or-more concurrent verdicts → Council.
- Three Park conditions (non-reproducible, VPN-vendor scope creep, operator unavailable).
- Explicit out-of-scope set: no code change, no PR #330 work, no Direct WSS Mode 2 work, no REST-SEND recon re-open, no pre-locked fix shape.

**Follow-ups:** J-1 runs as the first deliverable when the operator schedules it — host VPN ON/OFF reachability matrix from the Mac, no code, no fix shape. The recon does NOT block RC PR #330; RC #330's gating is the Direct WSS / Mode 2 track, which is the next forward direction for transport reliability work.

### 2026-06-26 · RC-PREKEY-PUBLISH-DEBOUNCE-RACE MERGED (PR #333 squash `5a5ce15b`) — prekey goal field-confirmed; full baseline still blocked by separate Emu outbound REST connectivity issue; RC PR #330 stays HOLD

**Outcome:** PR #333 lands on `master` as squash `5a5ce15b`, closing the mini-lock from PR #332 (master `768f23e6`). Three commit rounds, three CI passes, three review verdicts; head at merge = `b6be5e2b`. RC PR #330 is NOT touched — it stays Draft / HOLD until baseline message exchange becomes field-stable end-to-end (which depends on a new short recon track scoped below, NOT on this PR).

**Code shape:**

- Transport: `PreKeyApiClient` gains a `PublishResult.Deferred` sealed-class variant. The `tryLock` debounce branch returns `Deferred` (no synthetic `Stored(0)`). New `forceJoinInFlight: Boolean = false` parameter on `PreKeyApi.publishBundle`; with `true` the call suspends on `publishMutex.lock()` instead of short-circuiting, then runs its own publish attempt.
- Messaging-crypto: `PreKeyLifecycleService.verifyBundleOnRelay` passes `forceJoinInFlight = true` when the relay returns the canonical zero-record signal — both `signed_prekey_age_days == null` AND `remaining_opks == 0` per Inv-ForcePathOnZeroRecord verbatim (verified at source: `services/relay/src/prekeys.rs::status` `None => PreKeyStatus { remaining_opks: 0, signed_prekey_age_days: None }`). Per-session budget guard (`MAX_FORCE_REPUBLISH_PER_SESSION = 5`) gates the force path; exhaustion logs `PREKEY_TRACE verify_republish_budget_exhausted`. New `PREKEY_TRACE upload_deferred` log line replaces the pre-fix false-success `upload_ok stored_opks=0` from the debounce branch.
- Messaging-crypto: `MigrationManager`'s `when` arm on `PublishResult.Deferred` throws an explicit `MigrationException.PublishUnexpected` — the one-shot migration path never silently swallows a `Deferred`.
- Tests: 5 new in `PreKeyLifecycleServiceTest`, 2 new in `PreKeyPublishReliabilityTest`. The race-repro test reproduces the full deterministic chain in one body — publish #1 suspended on gated transport → verify sees zero record → publish #2 with force flag suspends on mutex → publish #1 dies (RuntimeException, not CancellationException — Round 3 fix per `b6be5e2b`) → publish #2 acquires mutex and returns `Stored(100)`. Six historical `PreKeyApi` fakes updated to match the new interface signature.

**Locked invariants landed (mini-lock §4):**

| Invariant | Outcome on `5a5ce15b` |
|---|---|
| Inv-NoFalseSuccess | `tryLock` debounce returns `Deferred`, consumer logs `upload_deferred` |
| Inv-RetryAfterFail | `forceJoinInFlight = true` suspends on mutex, retry runs after release |
| Inv-ForcePathOnZeroRecord | AND condition (`age == null && remaining == 0`) checked verbatim; negative test pins the AND |
| Inv-NoSpinningRetry | 5-attempt per-session budget; 6th call returns false without publishing |
| Inv-NoBaselineMaskingByRegression | All new tests assert observable behaviour (counts, force flag, mutex suspension), not log-shape |
| Inv-NoRcCoupling | No reference to any of the three RC release flags |

**CI on merge head `b6be5e2b`:** Android CI `28188108133` SUCCESS, Relay CI `28188108079` SUCCESS, Deploy lint `28188108105` SUCCESS, build-test SUCCESS. All four checks green at merge time.

**Field-smoke baseline replay (mini-lock §5 item 7) — PREKEY GOAL CONFIRMED, FULL BASELINE NOT PASS:**

- Tecno BF7-12 + Android emulator on Wi-Fi, post-fix APK `3d3317bd184c464337a6dd6e59bc2571eccbe659953b5e458a6802456decfb54`. Logs preserved at `C:\temp\smoke-pr333-baseline\` (tecno.log + emu.log).
- The exact pre-fix race scenario reproduced on the post-fix APK and resolved per Inv-ForcePathOnZeroRecord. Tecno timeline: bootstrap `upload_start` at `05:01:50.352`, `prekey_publish_start attempt=1/3` at `05:01:51.092`, concurrent `verify_start` at `05:01:51.411`, `verify_status spk_age_days=null opks_remaining=0` + `verify_republish_triggered` at `05:01:51.556`, bootstrap publish completes `prekey_publish_ok status=201` at `05:01:51.678`, `bootstrap_done` at `05:01:51.679`, force-republish (publish #2) `upload_start` at `05:01:52.157` (waited for mutex release), `prekey_publish_ok status=201 attempt=1` at `05:01:53.363`. Subsequent verify cycles see `spk_age_days=0` with `opks_remaining` decrementing 40 → 39 → 38 — bundle present on relay, peers consuming OPK.
- Pre-fix anti-pattern (synthetic `Stored(0)` from debounce gate masking a failing in-flight publish) was specifically searched for via `Select-String -Pattern "upload_ok stored_opks=0"` over both logs and is absent. The `upload_ok stored_opks=0` line that appears alongside `prekey_publish_ok status=201` is the post-PR-#323 expected shape (T2 carrier-ceiling fix skips the 2xx body read and synthesises an empty publish-result for the log).
- However, the user-visible message exchange smoke failed: the second emulator → Tecno message (`ac074425-0b5e-4721-9871-a305e9360a42`) never reached the relay. REST_TRACE shows `send_start attempt=1/5` at `18:46:47.220`, 5 consecutive `event=connectFailed exception=SocketTimeoutException` against `relay.phntm.pro/65.108.154.152:443` (each ~5006 ms), then `send_fail_giving_up total_elapsedMs=53110 attempts=5` at `18:47:40.330` and `SEND_TRACE relay_send_return ok=false`. The same destination IP also produced `ws_auth event=connectFailed` at `18:43:07` and `op=poll event=connectFailed` at `18:46:44` + `18:46:50` on the emulator within the same window — repeated total-loss-of-connectivity, not a single flap. Tecno saw lighter degradation (one 30 s `http_status_fail` plus 20 s status-call latencies) but stayed reachable.
- This is a sender-side transport/connectivity failure on the emulator: ratchet encrypt + sealed-sender pack + the entire crypto pipeline succeeded for `ac074425`; the bytes simply did not reach `:443`. It is **independent** of the prekey publish path that this PR touches, and outside the scope of this mini-lock's invariants.

**Verdict:** PR #333 closes the mini-lock contract it set out to close. Full baseline-replay PASS is NOT achievable from this PR alone because the remaining blocker is a separate transport-layer failure; conflating the two into a single gate would have held a useful fix hostage to a new unrelated network problem. RC PR #330 stays Draft / HOLD; its Tele2 LTE smoke does NOT retry until baseline message exchange is field-stable end-to-end.

**Follow-ups:** open a separate short recon / diagnostic track scoping the emulator outbound REST send timeout — network path vs client-side retry budget vs host-resolution. NOT a code-fix track in advance of facts; facts-first audit FIRST per the recurring rule. The new track lands its own mini-lock on `master` BEFORE any code work, per WORKING_RULES rule 3. RC PR #330 stays HOLD until that track lands and a clean baseline-replay PASS is observable.

### 2026-06-25 · RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 (#330) field-smoke v2 BLOCKED before Tele2 phase by Emu prekey publish debounce race + new track RC-PREKEY-PUBLISH-DEBOUNCE-RACE opened with mini-lock

**Outcome:** the v2 manual smoke against PR #330 head `6f49cd89` (architects APPROVED, Android CI `28023219092` SUCCESS 3m16s, APK SHA-256 `65ebaebf3a3f72e0eb8bc4bf381bcc85f72482370b0c401ad36a8d6f99803e35` with all three debug flags forced to `"1"`) could not establish a bidirectional baseline on Wi-Fi between a fresh-installed Tecno BF7-12 and a fresh-installed emulator peer. Tecno-side outbound to the emulator deferred 37 times with `SEND_TRACE prekey_fetch_result=404 — peer has not published yet`. Tracing the emulator log surfaced a race in the prekey publish coordination path.

**Empirical timeline** (preserved at `C:\temp\smoke-v2-20260625-1247\` on the operator workstation — `tecno-full.log` UTF-16, `emu-full.log` UTF-8, `tecno-utf8.txt` decoded, `baseline-blocker.txt` verdict):

  (no further publish attempts in the rest of the session)
```

**Verdict on RC #330:** NOT a FAIL on the reconnect-quiescence layer. Smoke was BLOCKED before the Tele2 LTE phase could begin, because bidirectional baseline could not be established at the messaging-crypto layer (the layer below RC's transport-quiescence surface). RC PR #330 stays Draft. No edits, no force-pushes, no merge. The code itself is APPROVED by the architects review pass on `6f49cd89` and Android CI is green; only the field-smoke gate (WORKING_RULES rule 8) is open, and it cannot be honestly closed until the prekey publish baseline becomes reliable.

**Locked invariants for the new track `RC-PREKEY-PUBLISH-DEBOUNCE-RACE`** (per WORKING_RULES rule 3, mini-lock-before-code):
1. A debounced prekey publish MUST NOT log `upload_ok` while the in-flight publish that suppressed it has not returned (Inv-NoFalseSuccess).
2. After the in-flight publish fails, the debounced republish MUST be retried so the bundle eventually reaches the relay (Inv-RetryAfterFail).
3. When `verify_status` reports `spk_age_days=null AND opks_remaining=0`, the republish path MUST bypass the debounce gate entirely — that case can never be the right one to debounce (Inv-ForcePathOnZeroRecord).
4. Retry path MUST honour the existing `attempt=N/3` budget AND a per-identity per-session retry budget; no busy-loop (Inv-NoSpinningRetry).
5. Tests MUST be deterministic and assert retry observability, not just log-shape (Inv-NoBaselineMaskingByRegression).
6. The fix MUST NOT depend on any of the three RC release flags (Inv-NoRcCoupling).

**Sequencing:** docs PR (this entry + `docs/tracks/rc-prekey-publish-debounce-race.md`) lands on master FIRST per Rule 3. Then the feature branch `feat/rc-prekey-publish-debounce-race` opens off the new master. After the prekey fix merges and the §5 item 7 field-smoke baseline replay passes, the RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 branch rebases on top, the APK is rebuilt with the three flags forced to `"1"`, and the Tele2 LTE smoke is retried per its existing template.

**Follow-ups:** mini-lock merge → feature branch + implementation → Android CI → field-smoke baseline replay PASS → RC PR #330 rebase → RC APK rebuild → Tele2 LTE smoke retry → RC PR Draft→Ready → merge → rollout PR. None of these steps proceed until the previous one passes.

### 2026-06-23 · RC-RECONNECT-QUIESCENCE1 draft PR #330 opened on `ecd67e04` + Android CI 30-min timeout on first run + retrospective rule-3 backfill (docs/tracks/rc-reconnect-quiescence1.md)

**Goal:** ship the typed `WsReconnectGate` + rewalk transaction surface that stops the Tele2 LTE reconnect-loop storms observed when R3.6 sticky-per-route was enabled during the Tele2 field validation (R3.6 release flags stay `"0"` post-merge — INACTIVE on production builds — the storms appeared under the debug-flag-enabled field run). Mechanism opt-in behind release-pinned `BuildConfig.RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED == "0"`; production behaviour unchanged at this PR's merge; a separate rollout PR flips the flag.

**Branch series at draft-PR-open time (head `ecd67e04`):** commit 1 (`69c8452c`, `disconnectAndJoin` lifecycle API + critical NonCancellable teardown), commit 2a (`70ace30b`, typed `sealed interface WsReconnectGate` in `WsReconnectGate.kt` + the single-lock atomic gate surface implementation on `RestStateMachine.kt` — owner-validated, generation-floor, bypass-locked), commit 2b (`35af30fb`, `runReconnectLoop` observes the gate), commit 2c (`89505e66`, `TransportRewalkCoordinator` transaction + `lastRewalkAtMs` invariant + typed `RouteChangeOutcome`), commit 2d (`c72c2b98`, `BuildConfig.RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` + `AppContainer` flag wiring + production `currentKindProvider` / `tokenSource` + release-pin + first-cut Test 20), commit 2e (`4e77f572`, closing test package — full integration `HybridRelayTransportIntegrationTest20` + deterministic flush-cancellation anchor + two strengthened test gaps — squashed from four rounds of chat-driven review iterations that widened seam visibility incorrectly, then reverted to `internal` + reflection bridge in `androidUnitTest`, then added real `bootstrap()`, then added the recovery half, then added a wire-recorder with positive control, then made the teardown fail-loud, then extracted the shared private `runReconnectMergeAndFlush` helper), commit 2e fix-round-4 (`2da35ebe`, removed the `-keep class phantom.core.transport.KtorRelayTransport { *; }` ProGuard wildcard that would have preserved every `*ForTest` seam in the release APK; added the `verifyR8StripsTestSeams` Gradle task wired as `finalizedBy` on `assembleRelease`; fail-loud commonTest teardown on three sites; shared `currentKindProvider` lambda in AppContainer), commit 2e fix-round-5 (`ecd67e04`, widened verifier scope from `phantom.core.transport.*` to all `phantom.*`; bounded the forensic `cleanupInflightForTest` reads inside fail-loud teardown so a stuck mutex cannot re-hang `@AfterTest`; dropped stale references and a duplicate import).

**R8 artifact proof.** Empirical: `assembleRelease` GREEN with the wildcard removed, `verifyR8StripsTestSeams: PASS — no *ForTest members survived on any phantom.* class`. Negative control: temporarily re-adding the wildcard breaks `verifyR8StripsTestSeams` with 127 violations, then removing it again restores GREEN. The mechanism catches future regressions by name.

**Android CI 30-min timeout on first run (`27997609089`).** The `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` task hung for 28 minutes inside `BodyTimeoutContractTest > r12_body_timeout_after_headers_does_not_retry_immediately` before the GitHub job 30-minute timeout fired. Local sweep on Windows had been GREEN throughout (`:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` 566 tests / 0 failures in ~35 s; `:apps:android:testDebugUnitTest + assembleDebug + compileReleaseKotlinAndroid` 140 tests / 0 failures in ~1 min 35 s). Suspect path: `RestStateMachineTestHelpers.kt:29` (`submitEventNow` wrapping `suspend submitEvent` in `runBlocking { ... }`) called inside `runTest(timeout = 5.minutes)` — `runBlocking` inside `runTest` is a known anti-pattern (test-scheduler dispatcher isolation vs blocking dispatcher). Locally hits the fast path in 0.213 s; on CI Linux x64 hangs. Diagnosis-before-fix: workflow `--max-workers=1` would mask, heap boost would mask, source repair is the root-cause path.

**Plan locked 2026-06-23:** (1) this docs PR — `docs/tracks/rc-reconnect-quiescence1.md` retrospective mini-lock + this `PROJECT_LOG.md` entry — merges first, repairing the rule-3 / rule-6 trail; (2) feature branch rebases onto the new master + two commits in the branch history (`69c8452c`, `c72c2b98`) are reworded via interactive rebase to drop personal attribution per the repo-artifacts-first-person-voice rule; (3) targeted source repair of `submitEventNow` / `onEventNow` call sites that live inside `runTest` bodies (the `BodyTimeoutContractTest` and `RestFallbackOrchestratorBreakerTest` sites visible to grep); (4) force-push the new head; (5) Android CI; (6) on the green SHA, fresh architects review pass (full and adversarial); (7) PR evidence comment with file:line refs + sweep proof + R8 negative test per rule 9; (8) APK with all three flags `"1"` from the exact PR head, SHA-256 recorded; (9) Tele2 LTE field smoke per rule 8 — only then mark PR ready and merge.

**Rule-3 / rule-6 retrospective backfill, honestly framed.** This was a process slip on this track — the feature branch opened and the PR was drafted before `docs/tracks/rc-reconnect-quiescence1.md` landed on master. The docs PR is committed as a separate docs-layer PR per rule 2; the mini-lock file's top section is explicit that it is a retrospective backfill, not a pretense that rule 3 was followed on time. After this docs PR merges the rule-3 contract is in effect for any further work on this track.

**Known limits acknowledged in the draft PR body and in the mini-lock §6:** (L-Test20-invocation-gap) Test 20 drives the shared `runReconnectMergeAndFlush` private helper via the test seam, not the production `runReconnectLoop:1287` call site — a future regression that removes the call site would leave Test 20 green; the structurally correct pin requires an integration test with a recording WebSocket session (Ktor MockEngine WS or embedded loopback server) and is deferred to a follow-up track. (L-Runtime-narrowness) The "no new runtime functionality" framing is too broad — three production-path branches added (`sendRawAttemptForTest?.invoke`, `flushEnteredForTest?.complete`, `flushReleaseForTest?.await`) fire the volatile-field READ on every call; production-observable BEHAVIOR is unchanged when seams are null, which is the rollout-relevant invariant. (L-Workaround-not-root-cause-on-CI) Even if the targeted source repair fixes the BodyTimeoutContractTest hang, any commonTest file that calls `submitEventNow` / `onEventNow` inside `runTest` could re-introduce the same hang; a follow-up audit track would scrub the wider commonTest surface.

**Follow-ups:** docs PR merge → feature-branch rebase + reword → source repair → Android CI green SHA → architects review pass → PR evidence → APK → Tele2 LTE smoke → ready/merge. Rollout PR follows separately and flips `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED`, `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED`, `RECONNECT_QUIESCENCE_ENABLED` from `"0"` to `"1"` together.

### 2026-06-21 · R3.6 sticky-per-route Fast REST degradation MERGED on master `e601cf3b` + Tele2 LTE failover and Wi-Fi recovery field PASS

**Goal:** ship R3.6 sticky-per-route on top of the bare 3.6 Fast REST fast-path (`d3935300`) so a single inbound WS `Frame.Text` can no longer flip the mode back from `RestActive` to `WsCandidate` while sticky is armed — closing the flap surface exposed by the 2026-06-18 Tele2 LTE smoke that had produced 18 `candidate_session_regression` cycles in 13 minutes.

**Outcome:** PR #328 squash `e601cf3b`. The R3.6 architecture (originally scoped through R1 → R3.5 → R3.6 impl-locked over five review iterations) introduces an ordered `WsSessionLifecycleEvent` channel (`Channel.UNLIMITED` + `receiveAsFlow` + checked `trySend`) replacing the legacy `wsSessionEnded` SharedFlow; a supervised single-collector dispatcher extracted as `internal class WsSessionLifecycleDispatcher` so unit tests drive the production code path with mock callbacks; a sticky-recovery state machine (`StickyRecoveryState { None, PendingNewSession, InFlight }` + `lastObservedEpoch` monotonic floor + 60-second `ws_alive_60s` probation cleanup hook at the top of `transitionToWsActive`). Field smoke on Tecno BF7-12 over Tele2 LTE → Wi-Fi route change 2026-06-21 01:46-01:54 PASS:

- Two control envelopes delivered via REST: `9e83b798` via `inbound_repair_ok promotion=true` (466 ms ingress → decrypt), `a0d26aaf` via plain `DECRYPT_TRACE ok` (142 ms ingress → decrypt).

Across 391 s of sticky window and 10 dead WS sessions the WS never delivered a `Frame.Text` during the suppression-eligible state. Unit coverage holds — `WsLifecycleDispatchBehaviourTest` 8 behavioural tests drive the production dispatcher with mock callbacks (R-A bootstrap retry / R-B detector mutex / R-C Connected non-trigger / IMPL-LOCK #4 continue-on-error / `CancellationException` propagation / L7 ordering through real channel→flow→dispatcher); `RestStateMachineTest.cleanup_completes_before_onModeSwitched_so_throw_does_not_leak_sticky` proves the cleanup hook runs before state mutation by transitioning back to RestActive after a throwing callback and asserting a follow-up `WsFrameTextReceived` triggers a real `WsCandidate` transition (would have been suppressed had sticky leaked).

**Side-finding (NOT part of R3.6 contract).** After `sticky_cleared`, the recovered Direct (`gen=2 s=13`) eventually died too — `gen=2 s=14 WebSocket connected successfully` at 01:54:16, ping timeout after 106 s / 5 successful pongs on Wi-Fi. This is a distinct WS-stability signature (NOT Mode 2 — Mode 2 needs zero inbound + 25-65 s duration). Feeds the next reconnect-quiescence / Direct-stability track; not relevant to the R3.6 failover contract.

**Rollout safety.** Release pins `MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` and `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` stay literal `"0"` in the release block of `apps/android/build.gradle.kts`. Build-time invariant `require(!(mode2StickyEnabled && !mode2FastPathEnabled))` in `RestStateMachine.init`. Debug opt-in via `localOrEnv("fastRestMode2"/"modeSticky", ...)`. Release pin enforced by `Mode2FastPathReleaseBuildConfigPinTest` and `Mode2StickyReleaseBuildConfigPinTest`.

**Key commits:** master `e601cf3b` (PR #328 squash); branch parent `d3935300` (bare 3.6 fast-path, originally tagged "FAILED on Tele2 LTE 2026-06-19 smoke" but the FAIL was traced to crypto-state contamination from `pm clear` + force-restart in the original runbook, not the 3.6 mechanism — the 2026-06-20 fresh-pair smoke confirmed 3.6 core works).

**Follow-ups:**
- Reconnect quiescence / backoff for the Direct-side WS-stability signature (NOT Mode 2) — separate next track.
- Direct WSS Mode 2 root-cause work — research direction, not promotion-blocking.
- Rollout flip (`MODE_2_FAST_PATH_ENABLED` and `MODE_2_STICKY_ENABLED` release pins `"0"` → `"1"`) — deferred until field evidence accumulates and the reconnect-quiescence track lands.

### 2026-06-20 · 3.6 bare Fast REST fast-path fresh-pair smoke PASS — 2026-06-19 FAIL re-attributed to crypto-state contamination

**Goal:** independently verify whether the 2026-06-19 bare 3.6 Fast REST fast-path smoke FAIL (18 `candidate_session_regression` cycles in 13 minutes) was caused by the 3.6 mechanism itself or by ambient crypto-state contamination from the original runbook's `pm clear` + force-restart sequence.

**Outcome:** fresh-pair smoke on Tecno BF7-12 over Tele2 LTE 2026-06-20 PASS. Pair re-created from a clean slate (Vladislav-led on operator workstation); APK and runbook identical to 2026-06-19 except the harness no longer does `pm clear` between sessions. Mode 2 detected at 31.04 s, ONE real `mode_switched reason=mode_2_fast_path` event (verdict-script counter showed 2 because a telemetry mirror line in `TransportRewalkCoordinator` matched the same grep — discounted), both control envelopes delivered via REST through the `seq_mac_verified loop=wsActivePollLoop` chain (`57cfbbf4` 2.17 s end-to-end, `0a428415` 1.79 s end-to-end), crypto clean (`fail_mac = 0`), ZERO `candidate_session_regression`.

The 18 regressions on 2026-06-18 are now attributed to crypto-state contamination (stale envelope + bootstrap timing collisions producing decrypt failures and reconnects). The raw `Frame.Text` defect (single inbound text in `RestActive` flips state to `WsCandidate` without crypto-outcome inspection) is NOT refuted by this run — simply not activated on the clean pair. R3.6 sticky-per-route remains the correct architectural fix; this smoke just demotes its priority from "blocker on Tele2" to "principled defence". Side-finding: 32 Direct WSS reconnects in 17 minutes — Direct loop costs battery + radio + handshake even when REST safety-net handles every control envelope; feeds the DWS-UX hardening track.

**Two R2.6 runbook bugs identified:**
- `$id:` PowerShell drive-prefix parse error in the verdict block (`"DECRYPT_TRACE ok msgId=$id:"` is parsed as a drive reference) — fixed in subsequent runbook iterations to `${id}:`.
- Wrong first-ingress marker: helper greps `REST_TRACE poll_received id=X` but production emits `REST_TRACE seq_mac_verified id=X seq=N loop=wsActivePollLoop` as the first per-id ingress marker on the wsActivePollLoop path.

**Key memory entries:** [project-3-6-fresh-pair-smoke-pass-2026-06-20] (durable verdict); [project-3-6-fast-rest-smoke-fail-2026-06-19] (re-attributed FAIL).

**Follow-ups:** R3.6 sticky-per-route code phase greenlit per architect frame — separate scope-lock work (eventually landing as PR #328 above).

### 2026-06-19 → 2026-06-20 · DWS-UX telemetry baseline + UX honesty fixes shipped (PR #327 squash `929b2072`); ADR-011 honesty pass (PR #326 squash `e05af400`)

**Goal:** ship the first track of the DWS-UX execution plan locked 2026-06-17 — telemetry baseline + UX honesty fixes — with ZERO actuation. Lay the observability foundation for the eventual Direct WSS hardening track without changing user-visible behaviour or transport semantics.

**Outcome:** PR #327 merges the four-piece DWS-UX-1 deliverable: `ws_ping_timeout_raw` raw counter, REST overlay reporting the actual `TransportKind`, Error-label discriminator distinguishing transport failure from delivery failure, and `retryWaitingMessages` source field exposing where the retry decision originates. Hard constraints honoured — NO ACK deadline / inbound stall / quiescence / Recovering suppression / optimistic placeholder / Direct WSS root-cause fix / Calls / TURN / Reality / attachments in this PR. PR #326 follows with the ADR-011 honesty pass, aligning four track docs with the post-PR-R0.4a actuation posture so the documentation no longer claims actuation in places where only observability ships. PR #325 (`63899f1f`, also in this window) is the docs-only voice notes Tele2 LTE smoke PASS evidence carried forward from the 2026-06-17 session.

**Follow-ups:** The 1-week production-observation gate that was originally locked for opening the DWS-1 scope-lock Council was cancelled in the subsequent reconnaissance pass; reconnaissance completed and R3.6 sticky-per-route shipped on top (PR #328). Next step is the reconnect-quiescence track to address the Direct-side WS-stability signature observed in the 2026-06-21 R3.6 field smoke side-finding.

### 2026-06-17 · Voice notes on Tele2 LTE smoke PASS — voice transport-independent contract empirically confirmed

**Goal:** field-verify the ADR-028 §"Layer 3" claim "voice = REST media" on the actual Tele2 LTE failure profile. The 2026-06-16 deep audit (4-agent fan-out + Ruflo independent verdict, durables at `C:\temp\direct-media-truth-audit-2026-06-16\`) reached consensus that voice manifest envelopes + media chunks structurally deliver via long-poll backbone + REST `/media/v3`, but flagged "voice-on-long-poll on Tele2 LTE" as NEEDS-FIELD-SMOKE — the Stage 2B-D 2026-06-16 smoke had been text-only.

**Setup.** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on Tele2 LTE (Wi-Fi off, LTE-only); emulator `emulator-5554` on host Wi-Fi. Same APK from master `2779c164` (debug variant, byte-identical to PR #323 post-merge sanity smoke APK, SHA-256 `c8dff3a0fb5f48359752d905dd89508f18beced90620a6ed7a8e4876d6a16684`). Fresh `pm clear` + onboard both. Pair via QR. Send a baseline text message, then voice notes in both directions, then wait for natural Mode-2 WS death, then more voice notes.

**Outcome — PASS + STRESS-PASS.**

| Voice note | Direction | mediaId | chunks | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tecno → Emu | `D3NB_pJG` | 9 | `MEDIA_TX manifest_sent` → emu `MEDIA_RX manifest_acked_and_queued` → emu `MEDIA_RX message_ready path=AUDIO_LOCAL` in ~22 s |
| 2 | Tecno → Emu | `SLKqCJJv` | 12 | same shape, ~26 s wall-time |
| 3 | Emu → Tecno | `6dJ3bIi1` | 9 | symmetric — receiver `message_ready` |
| 4 | Emu → Tecno | `FiH6PAoX` | 15 | symmetric — receiver `message_ready` |

Counter-evidence absent for all four voice notes: `MEDIA_RX download_failed = 0`, `MEDIA_RX decrypt_failed = 0`, `MEDIA_RX sha256_mismatch = 0`, `MEDIA_RX chunk_not_ready_deadline_exceeded = 0`.

**Stress evidence — voice delivered DESPITE active WS failure.** Tecno-side `REST_TRACE mode_switched WsActive → RestActive reason=active_outbound_ack_timeout` fired BEFORE the first voice send (the per-envelope ACK deadline tripped early); the first voice manifest therefore went through REST short-poll path from the start, not WS. Emulator-side cycled through **14 mode switches** during the smoke window (`inbound_idle_timeout → ws_frame_text_received → ws_alive_60s` loop every ~60 s). Tecno-side `ws_ping_timeout_diag = 32` confirms Direct WSS thrashed in canonical Mode-2 pattern throughout. Voice delivery remained correct end-to-end across all this.

**Other invariants verified by the same smoke window.** `prekey_publish_retry = 0` + `body_read_threw = 0` + `prekey_publish_ok = 2` + `body_read_skipped` fires — PR #323 T2 fix held. `inbound_repair_ok ... promotion=true` fired + `OpkNotFound = 0` + `fail_mac action=hold = 0` + `promotion=false = 0` — Sprint 2b-C OPK lifecycle held.

**Side-finding (NOT regression, NOT blocker, captured for future-track).** First message after pairing showed yellow dot ~8 seconds in UI; root cause `prekey_fetch_result=timeout 8s` + retry path (the PR-G3/G4-era artifact pattern). Retry succeeded (`prekey_publish_ok` follow-up), message delivered. Emulator UI periodically showed `Recovering` status — honest display of the 14 mode-switch cycle. Both observations are user-perceptible UX surfaces for the queued **DWS-UX hardening track** (next-track-pending), NOT for any voice fix.

**What this closes.** The single biggest open question from the 2026-06-16 deep audit: "does voice actually deliver on Tele2 LTE when Direct WSS dies?" Answer: **yes, and it does so because the long-poll backbone + REST media side-channel are real production paths, not theoretical claims.** ADR-028 §"Layer 3" contract verified by field evidence. Multi-transport reliability framing 2026-06-09 (item 5 "voice messages = REST/long-poll-compatible, MUST NOT depend on a live WS") verified by field evidence.

**What this does NOT close.** Direct WSS instability on Tele2 LTE is unchanged — that is by design per ADR-028 §"Bounded promise" and per the queued DWS-UX hardening track. The voice gaps catalogued in the audit (10 MiB-vs-1 MiB cap mismatch, no upload-resume across crash, receiver-side download cancel absent, voice blocked in Tor / Ghost) remain real and are tracked separately. Calls remain scaffold-only (no TURN, signaling gated on `WsActive`); voice smoke says nothing about calls.

**Smoke-template discipline lesson.** The PowerShell verdict script used grep markers (`early_manifest_sent`, `chunk_uploaded`, `download_complete`) that did not match the actual log line names in master `2779c164` (`manifest_sent`, `manifest_acked_and_queued`, `message_ready`). The script printed `INCONCLUSIVE` despite a clear PASS — a manual re-read of the raw log was required to surface the true verdict. Discipline correction: future smoke templates on new subsystems must grep the actual source for log markers before authoring, rather than relying on second-hand citations.

**Durable trail.** `C:\temp\voice-smoke-2026-06-17\logs\tecno-voice.log` + `emu-voice.log` (operator workstation, not in repo). Memory `project_voice_smoke_pass_2026_06_17` carries the structured outcome. Memory `project_dws_ux_hardening_track_pointer_2026_06_17` carries the locked next-track direction (intent: "Direct is fast when it can be, long-poll is reliable when Direct dies — make degradation fast, quiet, and understandable" — explicitly NOT "make Direct WSS reliable like long-poll").

### 2026-06-16 · T2 carrier-ceiling prekey-publish bug CLOSED on Tele2 LTE field evidence (PR #323 squash `5cf18e5f` + post-merge sanity smoke)

**Goal:** close the T2 carrier-ceiling `POST /prekeys/publish` bug that has been firing the `prekey_publish_retry SocketTimeoutException` pattern on every Tele2 LTE upstream publish since 2026-05-14. The 2026-06-16 Stage 2B-D smoke entry above mentions this class as a side-incident absorbed by Sprint 2b-C, but it remained an open Reliability-track item with its own field gate.

**Chain of evidence (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → PR #323 → post-merge sanity):**

1. **Phase 1 — baseline (PR #322 instrumentation, master `4dacd9d0`).** Tele2 LTE field run produced the five `T2_PUBLISH_PHASE` lines that proved the carrier middlebox delivers `headers_received status=201 protocol=http/1.1` in ~600 ms and then stalls the response body bytes; OkHttp's `Http1ExchangeCodec$FixedLengthSource.read` waits the full 60 s `readTimeout` for bytes that never arrive (the `phase=body_read_threw` event). This was Outcome A of the discriminator: response-direction stall, not upload.

2. **Phase 2 — experimental skip-body-on-2xx.** A debug-only gate (`PUBLISH_SKIP_SUCCESS_BODY_READ="1"`) on the same Tele2 LTE site reduced the publish call from 186 000 ms to 545 ms in a single attempt. The transport-layer fix shape was confirmed. Phase 2 also caught a second layer: with the body skipped, `PreKeyApiClient.publishWithRetry` then threw `JsonDecodingException` from `json.decodeFromString(PublishResponse, "")` and burned the retry budget anyway. The fix needed a transport-layer AND a lifecycle-layer change.

3. **PR #323 ship** (`5cf18e5f` squash). Transport layer: `AndroidNativeOkHttpPreKeyPublishTransport.publish()` now unconditionally skips `response.body?.string()` on any 2xx and returns `bodyText = ""`. Non-2xx still reads the body for error context. The experimental gate + the `skipBodyReadOnSuccess` constructor / factory parameter is retired across `commonMain` / `androidMain` / `jvmMain` / `iosMain`. Lifecycle layer: `PreKeyApiClient.publishWithRetry` 201 branch synthesises `PublishResult.Stored(storedOpks = 0)` when `bodyText.isEmpty()`, avoiding the empty-body decode throw. Three new unit cells cover (2xx + empty body → Stored(0)), (2xx + JSON body → decode unchanged), (non-2xx → body in `Failure.serverMessage` verbatim). The `T2_PUBLISH_PHASE` trace lines are kept on debug builds (gated by `BuildConfig.RELAY_T2_DIAG_CLIENT == "1"`) as a diagnostic-tier instrument for any future similar stall.

4. **Post-merge sanity smoke on Tele2 LTE — PASS.** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>`, master `5cf18e5f`, debug APK SHA-256 `c8dff3a0fb5f48359752d905dd89508f18beced90620a6ed7a8e4876d6a16684`, fresh `pm clear phantom.android` + reinstall, Wi-Fi off, Tele2 LTE. Onboarding-driven publish on a fresh identity. Single attempt at 08:01:18.806 → 08:01:19.507 local. Timeline: `prekey_publish_start opks=40 bodyBytes=5863 attempt=1/3` (08:01:18.806) → `T2_PUBLISH_PHASE phase=call_execute_start request_id=d0859dc224eec33f elapsedMs=0` (+7 ms) → `phase=headers_received status=201 protocol=http/1.1 elapsedMs=587` (+594 ms) → `phase=body_read_skipped status=201 elapsedMs=588` (+595 ms) → `PREKEY_TRACE prekey_publish_ok status=201 elapsedMs=588 attempt=1` (+701 ms). Total wall-time **701 ms**, down from the pre-fix 186 000 ms (~265×). Counter-evidence absent: `body_read_start = 0`, `body_read_end = 0`, `body_read_threw = 0`, `JsonDecodingException = 0`, `prekey_publish_retry = 0`, `publish_fail_giving_up = 0`. Independent architect review of the same log produced the identical verdict against an independent set of grep patterns.

**Verdict:** T2 carrier-ceiling prekey-publish bug **CLOSED** on field evidence. Both layers (transport unconditional skip-body on 2xx + lifecycle empty-body synthesis) confirmed working on Tele2 LTE post-merge.

**Out-of-scope side-finding (not blocking T2 verdict).** The same smoke window captured a WebSocket ping timeout ~30 s after the publish completed. This is a separate Direct WSS / mobile-LTE stability class (the architectural multi-transport reliability framing of 2026-06-09 designates WS as the fast path, not the reliability backbone; long-poll + REST short-poll fallback carry delivery guarantees). It does NOT regress T2 publish and does NOT alter the T2 verdict. Captured as a future-work pointer for the Direct WSS hardening track, NOT as an open T2 follow-up.

**Reliability-track posture after this close.** With T2 publish closed and Stage 2B-D Round 14 long-poll live on production relay (2026-06-16 entry above), the Reliability backbone is functionally complete for the current alpha surface. The remaining open Reliability items are Direct WSS hardening (separate track), Reality libXray Arm G (separate track), and Tor/Ghost parity (separate track) — each with their own scope-doc.

### 2026-06-16 · Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE integration smoke PASS + PR #310 MERGED + Round 14 LIVE on production relay

**Goal:** run the integration LTE smoke that gates PR #310 ready-for-review and the Stage 2B-D rollout flag flip — the same smoke the 2026-06-15 entry failed on Layer 3 with `errorClass=OpkNotFound action=fall_through_to_hold` → `fail_mac action=hold`. With Sprint 2b-A + 2b-B + 2b-C on master (PRs #315 / #316 / #317), the three-layer bundle was expected to flip Layer 3 to PASS while preserving the Layer 1 (Round 14 wire) and Layer 2 (Sprint 2a guard) PASS from the 2026-06-15 run.

**Bundle under test:**

- Master `fd8f93d9` (Sprint 2b-A + 2b-B + 2b-C + PR #318 docs merged).
- Client APK from `:apps:android:assembleDebug` against master `fd8f93d9` with `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED == "1"` (debug variant default), SHA-256 `7bdea25ea9064160c2e2f249881c5d059b7c56be5138dffc9f0f35bd3bd2824c`. `BuildConfig.java` verified to carry `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED = "1"` + `POLL_SKIP_LP_AND_PP = "0"` + `S6_DEBUG_TRIGGER_ENABLED = "1"` + the production `RELAY_URL`.
- Relay binary from `feat/round14-poll-chunked-flush` head `736973f1` (PR #310 pre-merge) deployed to `relay.phntm.pro` with `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` + `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS=30` + `RELAY_ENABLE_DIAG_SHAPE=0` (M13 mutex clean). Banner verified: `relay feature flags heartbeat_echo_enabled=true slow_post_diag_enabled=false poll_chunked_flush=true`. `/health` returned `HTTP/2 200`.
- Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on Tele2 LTE (Wi-Fi off, mobile data validated against a third-party browser fetch) + emulator `emulator-5554` on host Wi-Fi.

**Smoke window:** ~14:14 → ~14:20 local on Tecno (UTC-5 device clock), ~19:14 → ~19:20 UTC on relay clock. Logs durable at `C:\temp\stage-2b-d-smoke-2026-06-16\logs\`: `tecno-lte.log` (1586 lines), `peer.log` (737 lines), `stage-2b-d-relay-20260615-221017.log` (158 lines). Findings at `C:\temp\stage-2b-d-smoke-2026-06-16\findings.md`.

**Three-layer verdict — all PASS:**

1. **Layer 1 — Round 14 paced chunked-flush wire transport on Tele2 LTE — PASS.** 19 `phase_event op=poll event=responseBodyEnd byteCount=4608` events on the Tecno hybrid log; each one decomposes into 4 × 1152-byte chunks separated by ~250-300 ms inter-chunk paces, matching the locked Round 14 D15 contract. Sample first cycle (873 ms wall clock): `body_chunk cumulative_bytes=875 chunk_bytes=875 elapsedMs=2` → `cumulative_bytes=1152 chunk_bytes=277 elapsedMs=3` → `cumulative_bytes=2304 chunk_bytes=1152 elapsedMs=249` → `cumulative_bytes=3456 chunk_bytes=1152 elapsedMs=554` → `responseBodyEnd byteCount=4608 elapsedMs=873` → `body_chunk cumulative_bytes=4608 chunk_bytes=1152 elapsedMs=878` → `body_eof cumulative_bytes=4608 elapsedMs=878`. Relay-side mirror: 34 `rest_poll_returned` events all carrying `chunked_flush=true hold_secs=30 long_poll_opt_in=true padded_poll_opt_in=true`. The pre-Round-14 baseline reproduced the byte-budget stall on this carrier at ~3978 / 4608 bytes; under Round 14 all 4608 bytes arrived complete on every observed poll.

2. **Layer 2 — Sprint 2a outbound role guard on Tele2 LTE — PASS.** Peer log shows 3 hits of `SEND_TRACE bootstrap_path conv=190f3506d224 reason=responder_role_redirected` at 19:15:27.086, 19:17:40.728, 19:18:38.598 UTC. Each hit means the Sprint 2a guard at `DefaultMessagingService.kt:434` redirected the emulator's outbound from the existing-session path into the bootstrap branch, attached a fresh `x3dhInit`, fetched the recipient prekey bundle, ran the 4-DH bootstrap, and saved the new session — the same trail the 2026-06-15 entry validated, now repeated three times in one smoke window.

3. **Layer 3 — Sprint 2b-C inbound repair + promotion — PASS (the layer that broke on 2026-06-15, now clean).** Tecno log shows 3 `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_ok ... bootstrap=true ... promotion=true` events for msgIds `930a922b` (elapsedMs=138), `f8152025` (elapsedMs=140), `6a22457b` (elapsedMs=102) plus 3 steady-state `DECRYPT_TRACE ok ... bootstrap=false` decrypts for msgIds `43653c7c`, `15c61e5d`, `582747ff` after the bootstraps completed. The Sprint 2b-C runtime is now load-bearing in this trace: every fresh-bootstrap envelope went `commitBootstrap → promotePendingToActive` and emitted `promotion=true`. The deferred-consume contract from ADR-029 §L4 held. Counter-evidence absent: `errorClass=OpkNotFound` 0 hits, `fail_mac action=hold` 0 hits, `promotion=false` 0 hits, `pending_fallback_ok` 0 hits, `no_opk_in_x3dh_init` 0 hits. UI confirmation: Tecno rendered all four exchanged messages (`alpha-1`, `beta-1`, `alpha-2`, `beta-2`) without operator intervention.

**Bonus stress signal — Sprint 2b-C absorbed a broken upstream publish path.** Tecno's prekey lifecycle service attempted to republish its bundle during the smoke window and ran out of retries: `prekey_publish_retry attempt=1 reason=SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=60588` → `prekey_publish_retry attempt=2 elapsedMs=60588` → `prekey_publish_fail_giving_up attempts=3`. This is the pre-existing T2 carrier-ceiling slow-POST class on Tele2 LTE upstream documented at `project_t2_outcome_2026_06_05.md` — NOT a Round 14 / Sprint 2b regression. The Sprint 2b-C runtime nonetheless absorbed all three fresh-bootstrap envelopes cleanly because the emulator already held Tecno's pre-existing prekey bundle and the local `local_one_time_pre_key` rows that emu's `x3dhInit` referenced were still present in Tecno's pool (Sprint 2b-C deferred-consume = no eager delete). This makes the verdict stronger than a quiet baseline would have been: Stage 2B-D incidentally stress-tested Sprint 2b-C against a broken upstream publish path AND the crypto stayed correct.

**Verdict-script regex bug caught in independent review (informational).** The PowerShell verdict script in the smoke runbook patterned `body_chunk byteCount=1152` and returned 0 hits, suggesting Layer 1 partial; the actual log format is `body_chunk cumulative_bytes=N chunk_bytes=M`. A correct pattern (`body_chunk chunk_bytes=1152`) yields 16 hits across 4 successful poll cycles. The verdict logic itself did NOT consume the 1152 count in its pass/fail check (it gated on `byteCount=4608` >= 2, which was 19), so the final PASS decision was correct. The pattern is corrected in the runbook for future runs.

**Phase H rollback (post-smoke):** removed `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` from `~/Phantom/deploy/.env`, `git checkout master`, `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate relay`. Post-rollback banner: `relay feature flags heartbeat_echo_enabled=true slow_post_diag_enabled=false` (no `poll_chunked_flush=true`). `/health` 200. Production back on legacy mono padded poll while PR #310 finished review.

**PR #310 closed:**

- Rebased `feat/round14-poll-chunked-flush` from base `2ddb922a` onto current master `fd8f93d9` to clear the stale-base mergeable=false state. Conflict in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` resolved by keeping the 2026-06-16 Sprint 2b-C / M-OPK-3 entry from PR #318 + adding the PR's own 2026-06-15 Round 14 rebase entry in correct reverse-chrono slot.

4. Verified banner: `relay feature flags heartbeat_echo_enabled=true slow_post_diag_enabled=false poll_chunked_flush=true`. M13 mutex clean. `/health` 200.
5. Live traffic immediately observed: existing emulator identity `799dc224` connected, completed prekey publish, opened WS, polled. Relay log shows `rest_poll_returned ... chunked_flush=true hold_secs=30 long_poll_opt_in=true padded_poll_opt_in=true` on every poll. No errors, no panics, no M13 misfires.

**Round 14 chunked-flush is now LIVE on production relay.**

**PR consequences:**

- **PR #310** merged; this is the only PR change. `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED` is still `"0"` in the release variant (`apps/android/build.gradle.kts:591`), so production release builds (which are not yet shipped to users in Stage 2B-D) still emit no LP/PP opt-in headers; only the debug variant + this PR's test APK exercise the chunked-flush path end-to-end against production.
- **Stage 2B-D rollout flag flip** (`LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED "0" → "1"` in the release block) is the actual user-visible Stage 2B-D promotion. That flip is a separate follow-up PR (named separately so it carries its own review + rollback story). After this PROJECT_LOG entry merges, the rollout flag flip PR is the next ship.
- **Sprint 2b is functionally complete on Layer 3 per the amended L10 gate sequence** (`docs/tracks/sprint-2b-opk-pending-session-scope.md` §L10 amended 2026-06-16 in PR #318): Sprint 2b-A + 2b-B + 2b-C merged + Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE smoke PASS = the binding promotion gate is met.

**Durable trail:** `C:\temp\stage-2b-d-smoke-2026-06-16\findings.md` + the three captured logs + the PR #310 PASS comment at https://github.com/LiudvigVladislav/Phantom/pull/310#issuecomment-4711681426.

### 2026-06-16 · Sprint 2b-C MERGED + M-OPK-3 Wi-Fi run INCONCLUSIVE → Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE remains the real promotion gate

**Goal:** ship Sprint 2b-C runtime (pending→active promotion + outbound INITIATOR pending reuse + L4 deferred-consume end-to-end), then run the M-OPK-3 Wi-Fi field gate that `docs/tests/M_OPK_3_runbook.md` defines as the recommended pre-Stage-2B-D acceptance smoke.

**Sprint 2b-C ship.** PR #317 merged as master squash `7e421728` `feat(crypto): Sprint 2b-C — pending→active promotion + outbound INITIATOR pending reuse (#317)`. Six review rounds before merge: initial `7c1dba8e` carried Slices 1-5; Round 3 `b85738b1` closed the P1 `commitInitiatorPending` stale-reservation cleanup (mirror of Round 1 P1-1 but on the outbound path) + P2-A storage KDoc rewrite + P2-B DMS 3-DH vs legacy-fixture branch matrix; Round 4 `fc0b2820` dropped "single-table" wording for the now-transactional `commitInitiatorPending`; Round 5 `18d37cd0` rewrote the upper L4 §"Commit-or-rollback" under the final 2b-C model (the Sprint 2b-B intermediate dual-write demoted to a historical note); Round 6 `7fc7ad7e` replaced the §Amendment self-reference. Local sweep green across all rounds (`storage:jvmTest + messaging:jvmTest + transport:jvmTest + android:testDebugUnitTest + assembleDebug + compileReleaseKotlinAndroid`). GitHub CI: Android CI + Relay CI + Deploy lint all green on each pushed head. ADR-029 carries the binding state-machine + the deferred-consume tradeoff; `OpkNotFoundMetric` ships as a process-local debuggability seam (no telemetry export); `docs/tests/M_OPK_3_runbook.md` ships source-only as the field-gate runbook for the operator-applied `publishWithRetryDelayHook` (the hook itself is intentionally kept out of the merged tree).

**M-OPK-3 Wi-Fi gate execution.** Throwaway local branch `m-opk-3-throwaway-hook` cut from master at `7e421728`. Hook applied to `shared/core/transport/src/commonMain/kotlin/phantom/core/transport/PreKeyApiClient.kt` at the top of the `publishWithRetry` `for (attempt in 1..PUBLISH_MAX_ATTEMPTS)` loop, gated on `attempt == 2`, reading the stall millis from a SystemProperty via reflection (`Class.forName("android.os.SystemProperties").getMethod("get", String, String)`). The reflection shape kept `commonMain` platform-portable — `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` stayed green where the runbook's direct-reference diff would have broken it. Hook namespace switched from `phantom.test.publish_retry_delay_ms` to `debug.phantom_retry_delay_ms` mid-run because stock-Android SELinux denies `shell` domain writes to arbitrary prop names; the `debug.` prefix maps into `debug_prop` which shell can write. APK built (`d:\VL Stories Studio\Phantom\apps\android\build\outputs\apk\debug\android-debug.apk`), installed to Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` + `emulator-5554`, both wiped via `pm clear` for a clean pair. Pair completed, baseline `alpha-1`/`beta-1` exchange OK. Force-stop Tecno; `setprop debug.phantom_retry_delay_ms 5000`; relaunch Tecno; concurrent emu→Tecno `beta-2` send. Logcat captured to `C:\temp\m-opk-3-tecno-20260616-021243.log`. UI verdict: all messages delivered, no operator-visible breakage.

**M-OPK-3 verdict — INCONCLUSIVE (runbook flaw, NOT a 2b-C regression).** The log decoded cleanly (UTF-16 because PowerShell `Tee-Object` writes UTF-16 by default — initial ASCII `Select-String` grep produced false-negative zeroes). The actual content:

1. **`PREKEY_TRACE bootstrap_skip_existing_spk — local SPK already present, no publish`** fires ~3 seconds after Tecno relaunch. The local SignedPreKey row survived `force-stop` (it's just a process kill, not a data clear), so the prekey lifecycle service short-circuited the whole publish cycle at startup. `publishWithRetry` was never invoked → no attempt 1, no attempt 2, no hook fire site reached. The runbook's premise "the local prekey lifecycle service WILL publish on startup" is wrong for any relaunch flow that isn't preceded by a `pm clear`.
2. **emu's outbound carried `x3dhInit` correctly** (`DECRYPT_TRACE attempt msgId=ebfa70b0 ... x3dhInitPresent=true`) — the Sprint 2a outbound guard fired emu-side as designed.
3. **Existing-session decrypt succeeded on the first attempt** (`DECRYPT_TRACE ok ... bootstrap=false elapsedMs=64`). The active `ratchet_state` row was valid; the MAC verified. The Sprint 2b-C inbound-repair branch (which is what the M-OPK-3 gate is supposed to exercise) was never entered. The pending fallback branch (DMS:2455) was never entered either.

The gate as designed needs two things to happen concurrently: (a) `publishWithRetry` reaches `attempt == 2` so the hook can fire, and (b) the inbound active-session decrypt MAC-fails so the runtime drops into the inbound-repair branch. Neither happened in this run, so the Sprint 2b-C runtime code path was not exercised at all — therefore not proven working, but also not seen broken. No `OpkNotFound`, no `fail_mac action=hold`, no `promotion=false` in the log. **Honest summary: M-OPK-3 Wi-Fi run did not prove Sprint 2b-C, but also showed no regression. The runbook is flawed for relaunch-with-existing-SPK.**

**Decision — skip a hard-retry of M-OPK-3, move directly to Stage 2B-D.** A "Variant 2: fresh-pair scenario" workaround (`pm clear` Tecno before setprop, so the next pair triggers a publish cycle from zero) was considered. Rejected because that variant becomes a different test from the runbook's intent (it exercises first-pair publish, not the relaunch-with-existing-pair race the runbook describes); the unit-test coverage for the 2b-C runtime is already deterministic (`Sprint2bCStorageContractTest` + the `M-2bC-*` cells in `DefaultMessagingServiceTest`); and the integration scenario that originally manifested the 2026-06-15 `OpkNotFound action=fall_through_to_hold` failure shape is on Tele2 LTE — that signal is decisive in a way no Wi-Fi harness can be.

**Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE remains the real promotion gate.** The 2026-06-15 entry below describes the bundle and the failure shape we're testing against. Required state for the re-run: master at `7e421728` (Sprint 2b-C present) — already there; Stage 2B-B client backbone (PR #309) on master — already there; Round 14 relay (PR #310 head) deployed to production with `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` and `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS=30` — needs operator deploy from PR #310 branch + `.env` flip on VPS; client APK built with `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED=1` from master at `7e421728` — operator-built. Field run target window: same Tele2 LTE site as the 2026-06-15 smoke. PASS criteria: the integration end-to-end leg from the 2026-06-15 entry (Layer 3) — `inbound_repair_ok ... promotion=true` with the envelope rendering in the Tecno UI, and ZERO `OpkNotFound`/`fail_mac action=hold` for the same envelope shape that broke before. The other two layers from 2026-06-15 (Round 14 wire PASS, Sprint 2a guard PASS) are already validated; re-confirming them on this run is bonus but not blocking.

**Cleanup landed in this session.** Throwaway branch `m-opk-3-throwaway-hook` deleted locally; hook reverted from `PreKeyApiClient.kt`. `docs/tests/M_OPK_3_runbook.md` gains a "Known limitation" section documenting the relaunch-skip-publish flaw + the alternative `pm clear` variant for any future Wi-Fi-only harness attempt (it does NOT promote that variant to a binding gate — Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE is the gate).

**PR consequences:** PR #310 stays draft. Stage 2B-D promotion is still blocked on the integration end-to-end PASS that the 2026-06-15 run failed on. The Sprint 2b scope-doc L10 was amended in the same docs PR that ships this PROJECT_LOG entry: step 3's "+ Wi-Fi M-OPK-3 PASS" clause was removed, demoting M-OPK-3 from a binding gate to a documented field-shape harness; Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE PASS (step 4) became the single binding promotion gate. The amendment is recorded inline in `docs/tracks/sprint-2b-opk-pending-session-scope.md` §L10 and in `docs/tests/M_OPK_3_runbook.md` §"Policy update". After the amendment there is one consistent gate sequence across the three docs: Sprint 2b runtime is unit-test complete on master at `7e421728`; PR #310 ready and Stage 2B-D rollout flag flip remain gated on Stage 2B-D Tele2 LTE PASS.

### 2026-06-15 · Stage 2B-D pre-promotion integration LTE smoke — Round 14 transport PASS + Sprint 2a guard PASS + integration E2E FAIL (Sprint 2b promoted to primary)

**Goal:** run the single integration LTE smoke that gates PR #310 ready-for-review and the Stage 2B-D rollout flag promotion. The smoke validates the three-part bundle the path-B re-cut from earlier today scoped: Stage 2B-B client backbone on master (PR #309), Sprint 2a outbound role guard on master (PR #311), and the Round 14 paced-padded-poll relay patch (PR #310, branch `feat/round14-poll-chunked-flush @ 736973f1`) deployed to production with `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` and `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS=30`.

**Smoke window:** 21:23-21:43 CDT on Tecno BF7-12 `<redacted-device-serial>` over Tele2 LTE (`internet.tele2.ru`, validated) and `emulator-5554` over host Wi-Fi. Master baseline `2ddb922a`. Client APKs built from this master: APK-A baseline SHA-256 `520fbb7c…` (default `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED=1`, `POLL_SKIP_LP_AND_PP=0`) and APK-B diagnostic SHA-256 `2fe4c898…` (`-PpollSkipLpAndPp=1`). Phase A captures: Tecno logcat → `tecno-lte-C0.log`, emulator logcat → `emu.log`, relay docker logs → `relay.log` (all under `C:\temp\trek2-stage2b-b-d-integration-smoke-2026-06-15\logs\`).

**Three-layer verdict per the path-B re-cut decomposition:**

1. **Round 14 chunked-flush transport on Tele2 LTE — PASS.** 12+ separate polls observed `event=responseBodyEnd byteCount=4608` on the Tecno PhantomHybrid log, paced as 4 × 1152 inter-chunk with `elapsedMs ~900 ms` (matches the locked design of three ~300 ms inter-chunk pauses plus network). Headers contract honoured every call: `X-Phantom-Long-Poll=1 X-Phantom-Padded-Poll=1 hold_secs=30`. Relay log mirror: `event="rest_poll_returned" chunked_flush=true long_poll_opt_in=true padded_poll_opt_in=true hold_secs=30`. The pre-Round-14 baseline reproduced the byte-budget stall on this carrier at ~3978 / 4608 bytes; under Round 14 all 4608 bytes arrived complete on every observed poll. This is the strong wire-level PASS for the relay-side Round 14 fix on real Tele2 LTE.

2. **Sprint 2a outbound role guard on Tele2 LTE — PASS.** On the emulator's outbound reply path to Tecno: `SEND_TRACE bootstrap_path conv=1c79eb53ea6d reason=responder_role_redirected` → `SEND_TRACE prekey_fetch_start ... result=200 elapsedMs=457` → `SEND_TRACE bootstrap_init_ok` → `SEND_TRACE ratchet_encrypt_start bootstrap=true` → `SEND_TRACE save_session_ok`. The Sprint 2a guard at `DefaultMessagingService.kt:434` redirected the outbound from `session_existing` to bootstrap branch, attached a fresh `x3dhInit`, fetched the recipient prekey bundle (200 OK), ran the 4-DH bootstrap, and saved the new session — the exact path Sprint 2a's Wi-Fi smoke earlier today validated. The Round 13 `reason=responder_role_redirected` log refinement is visible in field.

3. **Integration end-to-end (emulator reply decrypt + Tecno UI) — FAIL.** On the Tecno inbound for that emulator reply (envelope `b493a2fb`): `handleDeliver start id=b493a2fb-3a3… sealed=true payloadBytes=1708` → `DECRYPT_TRACE attempt sessionExists=true x3dhInitPresent=true` → `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_armed reason=fail_mac_existing_session` → `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_fail errorClass=OpkNotFound action=fall_through_to_hold` → `DECRYPT_TRACE fail_mac x3dhInitPresent=true action=hold`. Tecno received the envelope and `seq_mac_verified` (transport contract honoured), saw `x3dhInit` attached, armed the PR #249 inbound X3DH repair, attempted the repair, and the repair failed because the private one-time prekey that the emulator's `x3dhInit` referenced was not available on Tecno at decrypt time. The orchestrator fell through to legacy `fail_mac action=hold`. User-visible: the emulator's reply is NOT in the Tecno chat UI. A subsequent manual emulator → Tecno send during the same window is also not arriving on Tecno UI, consistent with the hold state.

**Surrounding observation (NOT a verdict claim, NOT a root-cause attribution):** Tecno's Phantom process restarted during the smoke window (PID `28168` → `28998`), not user-initiated. The 10-minute REST_TRACE gap between Phase E half_open and the post-restart resume coincides with the restart. The temporal coincidence with the OpkNotFound failure is suggestive but not directly proven as cause-and-effect by these logs.

**Phase H rollback completed during the same session.** `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH` removed from `~/Phantom/deploy/.env` on the VPS, VPS git switched back to `master @ 2ddb922a`, relay rebuilt + force-recreated via `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate relay`. Post-rollback startup banner: `relay feature flags heartbeat_echo_enabled=true slow_post_diag_enabled=false` — no `poll_chunked_flush=true` token (default-off confirmed). `/health` returns `200 OK`. Production relay back on legacy mono padded poll behaviour.

**Phases not run:** Phase F (APK-B C1 diagnostic) — skipped because Phase E (C0) produced the positive Round 14 PASS signal and Phase F was the negative-control "show H1 inverts on header-strip". M1 (Caddy tcpdump) + M2 (carrier-ceiling probe) — skipped because the smoke verdict on Round 14 wire transport is conclusive at the client-side per-chunk byte log and the body did not stall in C0.

**PR consequences:**

- **PR #310 (Round 14 relay)** stays draft. The wire-level fix is the strong PASS; the integration end-to-end is the FAIL. Flipping to ready-for-review without an E2E PASS would misframe what the smoke validated. Verdict comment posted on the PR: `https://github.com/LiudvigVladislav/Phantom/pull/310#issuecomment-4704106270`.
- **Stage 2B-D promotion (LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED `"0"` → `"1"` in the release variant)** is blocked. Two of the four Stage 2B-D pre-promotion criteria are unmet: the Tele2 LTE smoke "no regressions in active session" criterion, and the implicit end-to-end-delivery criterion that the path-B re-cut baked into the rollout gate.
- **PR #309 (Stage 2B-B client backbone)** is unaffected — already on master, scope ends at the long-poll backbone semantics, recipient-side X3DH state was always out of scope.
- **PR #311 (Sprint 2a outbound role guard)** is unaffected — already on master. Sprint 2a's outbound side fired correctly on Tele2 LTE; this finding sits on the recipient side.

**Sprint 2b promoted to primary track (next-track lock):** Sprint 2b — pending/active state machine — is the next-track primary priority after this smoke. Its scope-lock must include OPK lifecycle / consumption / idempotency / restart-resilience behaviour as a MANDATORY inclusion, not as an optional follow-up. The race window documented at Sprint 2a merge (single-slot RESPONDER → INITIATOR replacement) is one slice of the problem; the OPK availability across process restart is a second slice that must be in the same scope-lock. After Sprint 2b lands on master, the integration LTE smoke can be re-run using the same three-part bundle plus Sprint 2b.

**Durable evidence:** `C:\temp\trek2-stage2b-b-d-integration-smoke-2026-06-15\` carries `findings.md`, `runbook.md`, and the three raw captures (`logs/tecno-lte-C0.log`, `logs/emu.log`, `logs/relay.log`).

### 2026-06-15 · Round 14 paced-padded-poll relay patch rebased onto master post-#309 + integration LTE smoke scoped as Stage 2B-D pre-promotion gate

**Goal:** refresh the Round 14 relay patch (PR #310) on top of the post-#309 master baseline (`2ddb922a` Stage 2B-B client backbone + `38ccc69b` pivot docs + `df34222d` Sprint 2a crypto fix) so the integration smoke can run against the actual three-part bundle that Stage 2B-D promotion gates on.

**What landed:**

1. **Round 14 relay patch (`6780fa6d` Sun 2026-06-14) re-applied as `917d5e98` on top of master `2ddb922a`.** Identical Rust diff (`services/relay/src/{config,main,rest_fallback}.rs` + `services/relay/tests/poll_chunked_flush.rs`); only the parent SHA changed because the branch had to leave its `94ba8d7a` fork point to land on a post-Stage-2B-B base. `cargo test --manifest-path services/relay/Cargo.toml --release --test poll_chunked_flush` produced 11/11 PASS on the rebased state. The unrelated `prekey_endpoints` test isolation flakes that surface in this branch's `cargo test` output are pre-existing on master and out of scope for this rebase.
2. **Stale durable-trail commit (`3a3909f9` Sun 2026-06-14) dropped.** Its content (the Round 14 LTE field evidence captured 2026-06-14 12:30-12:44 UTC on Tecno BF7-12 + Tele2 LTE) is preserved here in this fresh entry; the original commit conflicted on `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` and `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` against the post-#311 / #312 / #309 layout and could not be replayed without restructuring three unrelated session-journal entries. Re-writing here keeps the LTE evidence accessible without forcing a contrived merge across the four downstream tracks.
3. **PR #310 branch force-pushed.** `feat/round14-poll-chunked-flush` moves from `6780fa6d` → `917d5e98`; original baseline was `+1` doc commit ahead of `origin` and now is `+1` (the same Round 14 code) on top of current master. The PR #310 body still records the field-validation evidence; this rebase only refreshes the diff so the next field session can run against a build that contains the Stage 2B-B client backbone, the Sprint 2a crypto fix, and the Round 14 chunked-flush patch in one place.

**Round 14 LTE field evidence (preserved from the dropped commit):**

Tele2 LTE on Tecno BF7-12, 2026-06-14 12:30-12:44 UTC. The Round 14 paced-padded-poll patch produced 100+ polls each delivered as 4 × 1152-byte chunks with ~300 ms inter-chunk pauses, totalling the byte-EXACT 4608 D15 contract, followed by `body_eof`. Earlier baseline diagnostics on this carrier class reproduced the byte-budget stall around ~3978 / 4608 bytes; in this run the paced response completed at the full 4608 bytes repeatedly. F2 wire shape closed via M5 unit test + logcat body confirmation. M13 mutex caught a stale `RELAY_ENABLE_DIAG_SHAPE=1` leftover at pre-flight. Rollback verified clean at 12:44:45 UTC. Field findings at `C:\temp\round12-field-measurement-2026-06-14\F1-F2-findings.md`. The PR #310 comment at https://github.com/LiudvigVladislav/Phantom/pull/310#issuecomment-4701800603 carries the same evidence with two hedges (earlier-baseline diagnostics not same-session A/B; M5 covers server-side L-CL-1, logcat confirms 4608 received — not logcat=wire).

**Integration smoke scoped, NOT executed.** The integration LTE smoke that gates PR #310 ready-for-review is the three-part bundle Stage 2B-D promotes against: (i) post-#309 master client APK built with `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED == "1"`, (ii) Round 14 relay binary deployed to the production relay with `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` set in the VPS env, (iii) the Sprint 2a crypto outbound role guard already on master so the `fail_mac action=hold` desync class that contaminated earlier baselines is closed. The integration smoke runbook lives at `C:\temp\trek2-stage2b-b-d-integration-smoke-2026-06-15\runbook.md` (durable trail outside the repo until the smoke runs against real VPS deployment).

**Key commits:** `917d5e98` Round 14 relay patch on rebased Round 14 branch (PR #310 force-pushed).

**Follow-ups:** integration LTE smoke per the runbook → if PASS, PR #310 ready-for-review + Stage 2B-D promotion proceeds → if FAIL, root-cause per the runbook's three-part attribution matrix.

### 2026-06-15 · RC-CRYPTO-PAIR-X3DH-INIT Sprint 2a outbound role guard SHIPPED on branch (PR #311) + field smoke PASS on Vladislav setup

**Goal:** ship the smallest behavioural fix that closes H1 from the Sprint 1 foundation (`88e472af`), validate on Vladislav's real two-device pair under Wi-Fi, and open a draft PR — without expanding scope into the Sprint 2b pending/active state machine that would require schema work.

**What landed (branch `feat/rc-crypto-pair-x3dh-init-root-cause`, initially validated locally and then pushed for review as PR #311):**

1. **Sprint 2a outbound role guard — commit `14b8033c feat(crypto): outbound role guard at encryptUnderLock — Sprint 2a`.** The existing-session branch at `DefaultMessagingService.kt:434` now requires the loaded state to be `INITIATOR`-tagged AND `!sessionSuspect`. A `RESPONDER`-bootstrapped session (created by `recipientBootstrap` / `recipientBootstrapInMemory` when the peer received an `x3dhInit` from Tecno first) is redirected into the bootstrap branch — runs a fresh X3DH 4-DH exchange in the local→peer direction, attaches `x3dhInit` to the outbound `WireFrame`, and writes a new INITIATOR row. Three new tests added to `DefaultMessagingServiceTest.kt`: U1 (RESPONDER seed → bootstrap path + `x3dhInit` emitted), U2 (INITIATOR seed → existing-session path no `x3dhInit`, regression vs OPK storm), U3 (INITIATOR + `sessionSuspect=true` → bootstrap path). Storage inspection during scope-lock confirmed `RatchetStateRepository` is single-slot per `conversation_id` (PRIMARY KEY), so the new INITIATOR row REPLACES the RESPONDER row on `saveSession`. Sprint 2a accepts this race window explicitly and pushes pending/active into Sprint 2b. Backwards-compat: untagged legacy `rs1:` blobs deserialize as `INITIATOR` (Sprint 1 default), so the guard is a no-op for any session row written before the role field existed.

2. **Field smoke PASS on Vladislav's setup.** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` + emulator `emulator-5554`, both running the same `14b8033c` build, Wi-Fi only, `pm clear phantom.android` on both, fresh QR pair. Two-message smoke: Tecno→emulator "alpha" (creates the RESPONDER session on emulator), emulator→Tecno "beta" (THE Sprint 2a guard test). Results: emulator outbound event #3 (the "beta" reply) took the `bootstrap_path` branch and attached `bootstrap=true`. Tecno received envelope id `21350350` with `sessionExists=true x3dhInitPresent=true`, triggered PR #249's `inbound_repair_armed reason=fail_mac_existing_session`, and `inbound_repair_ok bootstrap=true plaintextBytes=126 elapsedMs=77`. Zero `action=hold` across the entire log. Four successful Tecno decrypts in the run (2× `inbound_repair_ok` for bootstrap envelopes carrying `x3dhInit`, 2× plain `DECRYPT_TRACE ok` for follow-up envelopes on the freshly-rekeyed session). User confirmation verbatim: "все сообщения теперь пришли, и быстро даже приходят". Architect independent review converged on the same verdict. Durable evidence at `C:\temp\sprint-2a-field-smoke-2026-06-15\` (findings.md + tecno.log + emulator.log).

3. **Minor log text fix in the same commit window.** The pre-Sprint-2a bootstrap_path log read `— no existing session` even when `existingState != null` but `role=RESPONDER` (mechanism correct, text misleading). Tightened to `SEND_TRACE bootstrap_path conv=$convTag reason=$bootstrapReason` where reason ∈ {`no_session_row`, `responder_role_redirected`, `session_suspect`, `unknown`}. `:shared:core:messaging:jvmTest` BUILD SUCCESSFUL after the amend.

**What Sprint 2a does NOT claim:**

- Sprint 2b pending/active state machine still open. Single-slot REPLACE semantic means a peer-side concurrent send within the bootstrap-processing window (seconds to minutes on Tele2 LTE) can still race.
- A1–A4 security mitigations not in scope.
- LTE not validated in this smoke — Wi-Fi only.
- Round 14 / PR #310 / PR #309 not touched.

**Why ship Sprint 2a as its own PR (Vladislav decision 2026-06-15):** Sprint 2a already delivers real user-visible value — the recurring asymmetric `fail_mac action=hold` after fresh clean-state pair (bitten three field tests: 2026-05-30 sealed read receipts + 2026-06-14 WiFi + 2026-06-14 Tele2 LTE) no longer needs a reset button to recover. Waiting for Sprint 2b's pending/active state machine to absorb the race window risks re-bloating into multi-day schema/DAL work and delaying the proven fix. The PR body must be honest about scope: primary fresh-pair asymmetric path fixed, race window explicitly documented as Sprint 2b follow-up, no claim that all crypto desync cases are solved.

**Key commits on branch:** `88e472af` Sprint 1 foundation, `14b8033c` Sprint 2a outbound role guard + smoke PASS.

**Follow-ups:** Sprint 2b pending/active state machine independent of the transport track. Sprint 3 (Fix 2 + A3) → Sprint 4 (Fix 3 + A4) → A5 (separate ticket).

**Direction pivot — same day (2026-06-15) post-merge.** The earlier queue point "short LTE retry on master after #311 merges, then flip PR #310 to ready-for-review" turned out to be assembly-heavy in a way the wording hid. Round 14 (`6780fa6d`) is relay-side only; the chunked flush only fires when (a) the relay binary is deployed AND `RELAY_POLL_CHUNKED_FLUSH=1` is set in the env, AND (b) the client opts in via `X-Phantom-Long-Poll` + `X-Phantom-Padded-Poll` headers. Client opt-in requires `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED=1` BuildConfig (release pin currently `"0"`), AND the Trek 2 Stage 2B-B client implementation is still on `feat/pr-trek2-stage2b-b-impl @ 84f96707` and has not been merged to master. Hand-assembling all of these for a single "short LTE retry" on a throwaway branch would be a 4-6 hour integration prog, not a smoke, and any FAIL would not cleanly point at one cause. **Decision:** Sprint 2a is closed on the Wi-Fi smoke evidence captured above (the crypto root cause is in `shared/core/messaging`, not transport-dependent). The LTE retry is moved to the integration phase that follows once (i) Stage 2B-B client implementation is merged to master, AND (ii) the Round 14 relay binary is deployed with the chunked-flush env flag on. That single integration smoke then validates Sprint 2a crypto + Stage 2B-B client + Round 14 relay together on real Tele2 LTE in one run. PR #310 stays draft until that integration smoke; PR #309 untouched.

### 2026-06-14 → 2026-06-15 · RC-CRYPTO-PAIR-X3DH-INIT Track A Council CLOSED + Sprint 1 foundation SHIPPED LOCAL (NOT pushed)

**Goal:** root-cause the recurring asymmetric `fail_mac action=hold` with `sessionExists=true, x3dhInitPresent=false` on peer→Tecno after fresh clean-state pair — bitten three field tests now (2026-05-30 sealed read receipts + 2026-06-14 WiFi attempt + 2026-06-14 Tele2 LTE retry). The crypto-track precedes any move on PR #310 Round 14 transport (which itself ships correctly on real LTE but cannot be validated end-to-end while delivery is silently broken).

**What landed (LOCAL only, branch `feat/rc-crypto-pair-x3dh-init-root-cause` at commit `88e472af`, NOT pushed):**

1. **Track A Council — root cause identified.** Two prior Council rounds had drifted into Design A v2, a multi-month platform initiative (1,800–2,400 LOC + 6 PRs + new wire types + relay coordination) that Vladislav rejected as scope-bloated. Path 2 re-Council on smaller alternative landed P6-extended (user-visible reset banner) as synthesis-v3, also rejected as symptom-treat. Track A re-scoped Council to root-cause only — “before implementing fallback UX, can we identify and fix why clean-state pair produces asymmetric fail_mac?”. All four lenses (KMP + architect + security + tester, Ruflo sonnet via the patched 300s timeout) converged on **H1**: when Tecno→peer arrives and peer’s `handleDeliver` runs `recipientBootstrap` (or PR #249’s in-memory variant), the resulting session record gets persisted under `contactId=Tecno` with no role tag. When peer subsequently sends peer→Tecno, `tryLoadSession(conversationId)` returns this RESPONDER-bootstrapped record. `encryptUnderLock:434` evaluates `existingState != null && !sessionSuspect == TRUE`, takes the existing-session path, and encrypts under the RESPONDER’s sending chain without attaching `x3dhInit`. Tecno’s INITIATOR ratchet expects messages from the INITIATOR’s sending chain — the chains diverge and Tecno’s MAC verification fails. PR #249’s inbound X3DH repair never fires because `wireFrame.x3dhInit == null`.
2. **8 shallow + 4 deep grep verifications confirmed H1 in the code.** `SessionManager.tryLoadSession:77-80` uses `conversationId` only, no role distinguisher. `DefaultMessagingService.kt:434` condition is verbatim `if (existingState != null && !sessionSuspect)`. `saveSession` for the RESPONDER bootstrap happens at `DefaultMessagingService.kt:2818` (normal handleDeliver bootstrap branch) and `:2531` (PR #249 repair branch after candidate-decrypt succeeds). Deep verifications: V5 deep refuted H4 (the QR/contact-add flow does not call `saveSession` with partial state — no separate pair-flow persistence; the broken record originates only in handleDeliver post-receive); V6 deep clarified PR #249 OPK consumption is one-shot per call (OPK consumed eagerly inside `recipientBootstrapInMemory` before the X3DH handshake; on subsequent retry the OPK is already gone, the call throws cleanly, and the existing session row remains byte-identical — not a blocker for Track A); RatchetState schema migration verified as Option A backwards-compat default (kotlinx.serialization decodes legacy `rs1:` blobs missing the role field with default `INITIATOR`, no codec version bump needed); `sendDeliveryAck` is a single `RelayTransport` interface method dispatching to WS (`KtorRelayTransport:1425`) or REST (`RestFallbackOrchestrator:528` against `/relay/ack-deliver`), so a future bounded-ACK mitigation reuses the same call site for wire-indistinguishability.
3. **Falsify-first controlled run 2026-06-15 confirmed the sender-side half of H1 on real devices.** Clean wipe (`pm clear phantom.android`) both Tecno phone + emulator; fresh QR pair; logcat captured. Emulator log shows 4 outbound sends to Tecno after the first inbound from Tecno arrived, each producing `SEND_TRACE encrypt_lock_acquired → session_lookup conv=d03e03a27aea suspect=false → session_existing → ratchet_encrypt_start`. Zero `SEND_TRACE bootstrap_path` for outbound to Tecno across the entire session. Receiver-side `fail_mac` was not captured in this specific run — Tecno’s REST poll entered `breaker_open_ConsecutiveRestFailures` after an `InterruptedIOException totalMs=35004` at 13:05:38 and never received the emulator outbound envelopes — but the receiver-side `fail_mac action=hold` consequence is already on record from three prior field tests. Sprint 1 commit message frames this honestly: sender-side mechanism confirmed in controlled run; receiver-side consequence confirmed by prior field logs.
4. **Sprint 1 foundation shipped LOCAL.** Commit `88e472af feat(crypto): tag X3DH session role on RatchetState` on branch `feat/rc-crypto-pair-x3dh-init-root-cause` (from master `94ba8d7a`). 4 files, +491/-3 LOC. Adds `phantom.core.crypto.SessionRole` enum (INITIATOR / RESPONDER) and a `role: SessionRole = INITIATOR` field on `RatchetState` with equals/hashCode updated. `SessionManager.initiatorBootstrap` tags the persisted state as INITIATOR; `SessionManager.recipientBootstrapInMemory` tags the returned candidate as RESPONDER (which `recipientBootstrap` then persists via its existing `saveSession` call, and PR #249’s repair branch picks up via the same return-value-then-`saveSession` pattern at line 2531 — no plumbing change required at either downstream site). 8 new tests, all green: `RatchetStateRoleTest` (5 cases — default INITIATOR, copy-inequality, serialization roundtrip, legacy JSON without role decodes as INITIATOR for backwards compat, ratchet evolution preserves role via `.copy(...)`) and `SessionManagerTest` (3 cases — each of the three bootstrap entry points tags the correct role on the returned/persisted state). `:shared:core:crypto:jvmTest` + `:shared:core:messaging:jvmTest` + `:shared:core:storage:jvmTest` all BUILD SUCCESSFUL. **Sprint 1 is the state-model fundament, NOT a behavioural fix** — no outbound code path consumes the role field yet. Real treatment begins in Sprint 2 when the outbound guard reads the tag.

**Why Sprint 1 stays local:** Vladislav-locked rule that the branch does not push until Sprint 2 (outbound guard + pending/active state machine) also lands locally green and the smallest diagnostic test passes on his setup. The smallest diagnostic test (`H1_responder_session_blocks_outbound_x3dhInit`, ≤8 minutes single-device) was designed by the tester lens and is the Sprint 2 acceptance smoke: Tecno→emulator first creates the RESPONDER session on emulator, emulator→Tecno must then decrypt cleanly with the guard log line present and zero `fail_mac` on Tecno. PR #310 Round 14 transport stays draft — the field-evidence comment posted 2026-06-14 already frames it correctly (transport validated, end-to-end blocked by this crypto track), and ready-for-review unblocks only after Sprint 2+ landed and the F1 LTE retry passes end-to-end.

**Sprint 2 framing (next session, scope-lock before code):** start by inspecting actual storage / session APIs to decide whether the pending/active state machine fits inside the existing `RatchetStateRepository` without schema changes. If yes — ship Sprint 2 as one coherent unit (outbound guard at `DefaultMessagingService.kt:434` + pending/active state machine + tests). If the pending slot needs new schema / migration / significant DAL work, split into Sprint 2a (outbound guard + bootstrap-path `x3dhInit` attach + tests) and Sprint 2b (pending/active state machine on top of 2a once 2a is field-smoke-validated). Direction is locked regardless of split: **no user-visible reset button, automatic role-aware session correction so the user never sees the broken state**.

**Key commits (LOCAL):** `88e472af` Sprint 1 foundation. `3a3909f9` Round 14 docs durable trail (independent branch `feat/round14-poll-chunked-flush`, also LOCAL, also not pushed).

**Out of scope for Sprint 1:** outbound guard at line 434, pending/active state machine, the five Council security mitigations (A1 sender identity binding / A2 pending-slot write-once / A3 sessionSuspect rate-limit / A4 QR-pair fingerprint immutability / A5 envelope replay window), Fix 2 sessionSuspect escalation, any new wire type or envelope type, any relay-side change, any schema migration.

**Follow-ups:** Sprint 2 scope-lock (next session, no code first) → Sprint 2 / 2a code → field smoke → Sprint 3 (Fix 2 + A3) → Sprint 4 (Fix 3 + A4) → A5 (separate ticket). Memory entry `project_rc_crypto_pair_x3dh_init_sprint_1_2026_06_15.md` carries the full plan including the conditional split. Durable findings at `C:\temp\rc-crypto-pair-x3dh-init-council-2026-06-14\` cover Council outputs (`root-cause-{architect,security,kmp,tester}.md` Track A 4-lens) and the synthesis chain (`synthesis-track-A.md` → `synthesis-track-A-amended.md` → `synthesis-track-A-amended-2.md`) plus the Sprint 1 ship summary (`sprint-1-shipped-2026-06-15.md`).

### 2026-06-10 · Trek 2 Stage 1.x SHIPPED + Stage 2B-A scope merged + Trek 1 V3 CLOSED FAIL (backbone-first delivery batch)

**Goal:** ship the server-side prerequisite the client long-poll backbone needs, lock the client-side shell scope behind it, and record the Trek 1 closure. Three logical events compressed into one calendar day because the dependencies chain end-to-end: Trek 1 closure clears Reality as the primary fast path → backbone becomes the strategic priority → Stage 1.x server prerequisite must ship before the Stage 2B-A shell can be safely scoped → Stage 2B-A scope locks the client contract for the next implementation PR.

**What landed:**

1. **Trek 1 Stage 1 / RC-LIBXRAY-REALITY-WIRE1 V3 xhttp matrix CLOSED FAIL** — brief commit `df082528` (2026-06-09). The Reality app-level matrix V1/V2/V3 is exhausted on RU mobile carriers; the byte-identical 1440-byte ClientHello stall is now localised to the libXray Android gomobile write path (single TCP segment of size MSS, then write stops; WSL2 Linux Xray on the same config produces 2 segments and reaches HTTP/2 200). Server + network + MSS clamp + bans all ruled out as causes. Track decision: demote Reality to diagnostic surface for the carrier; scope the sub-track `RC-LIBXRAY-REALITY-WIRE1` in `docs/tracks/rc-libxray-reality-wire1.md` but do NOT start it. Reality stays in the toolbox as a privacy primitive (Stage 5E remains production) but stops being a primary realtime fast-path candidate on RU mobile.
2. **Trek 2 Stage 1.x scope-doc trio merged** — PR #300 (scope mini-lock) + PR #301 (Round 3 review amendments) + PR #302 (voice cleanup). Master at `0e4c25ea` after the trio. Scope doc `docs/tracks/trek2-stage1x-server-prereq.md` becomes the binding contract for the implementation PR. Four server-side locks identified: Lock-1 store-time `seq_mac` end-to-end / Lock-2 padded-vs-held header decoupling / Lock-3 atomic `RestTokenStore::issue()` invariant / Lock-4 `HoldSlot` + per-identity hold cap + dual-layer 480s clamp.
3. **Trek 2 Stage 1.x server prerequisite SHIPPED** — PR #303, master `e3794e6e`. Seven commits: six A-deliverables A1-A6 per the scope-doc commit boundary, plus the Round 2 review-fix bundle. Highlights:
   - New `services/relay/src/seq_mac.rs` module — `SeqMacRootKey(Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>)` with `[REDACTED]` `Debug`, per-identity verify-key derived via `HMAC(root_key, "phantom-seq-mac-key-v1\x00" || identity_hex)`. The root key never leaves the relay process. `RelayConfig::seq_mac_key: Arc<SeqMacRootKey>` field; relay fails to start if `RELAY_SEQ_MAC_KEY` env var is absent or malformed.
   - Lock-1 MAC computation at STORE time (not response time) in `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store` over the canonical tuple `(identity_hex, seq, envelope_id, sequence_ts_post_quantize)` with length-prefixed UTF-8 encoding (101 bytes + `envelope_id_len` bytes). `RestEnvelope.seq_mac: String` column; `PollEnvelope.seq_mac` on the wire; `SessionResponse.seq_mac_verify_key: String` always present on the wire. The locked threat-model wording is verbatim in three places: scope doc, PR description, `///` doc-comment on `PollEnvelope.seq_mac`.
   - Lock-2 padded-vs-held header decoupling: new `X-Phantom-Padded-Poll` header constant alongside `X-Phantom-Long-Poll`; `padded_opt_in = long_poll_opt_in || padded_poll_opt_in`. Hold path stays gated on LP alone; padding gate switches to `padded_opt_in`. Kill-switch decoupled: `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS=0` zeros the hold timer but does NOT strip the padded body shape from PP-opted-in clients.
   - Lock-3 atomic `RestTokenStore::issue()` (structural single critical section across `by_token` + `by_identity` in lock order matching `purge_expired`). Post-rotation challenge replay returns `410 Gone` with body `{"error":"session token rotated; obtain a fresh challenge"}` via new `refresh_specific_token_if_live(token)` helper.
   - Lock-4 `HoldSlot { notify: Notify, hold_count: AtomicU8 }` widens the per-recipient notifier map. `HoldGuard::try_acquire(slot)` runs a `compare_exchange` CAS loop bounded by `PER_IDENTITY_HOLD_CAP = 3`. `MAX_POLL_HOLD_SECS_CAP = 480` dual-layer clamp (config-parse and runtime). `PollOutcome { Ready, HoldCapExceeded }` enum return for `429 Too Many Requests` + `Retry-After: 30` mapping.
   - Round 2 review surface: 4 BLOCKERS identified after CI green — atomicity race in `issue()`, cache-hit returning current token after rotation, missing recipient `to` validation + WS messageId byte-length validation + `.expect()` on client-controlled input in `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store`, stale doc-comment on `/auth/session`. All 4 closed in one bundled commit `8cf7d582`. The atomicity fix IS a structural refactor (the A4 doc-comment + tests landed first; this bundle locked the invariant into the structure itself). The `.expect()` fix changed `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store` return type from `u64` to `Option<u64>` — the panic on client-controlled input is gone by type.
   - Round 3 cleanup commit `e5391094`: replay test tightened to pin `StatusCode::GONE` + locked body strings (`"rotated"` + `"fresh challenge"`); stale comment in `rest_fallback_endpoints.rs` that claimed a non-existent `rejects_oversized_messageid` test rewritten to honestly explain the WS coverage strategy (shared `is_valid_*` helpers in `seq_mac.rs` + compile-time `Option<u64>` return type); 5 clippy nits cleared so `cargo clippy -p phantom-relay --tests -- -D warnings` is clean end-to-end.
   - Final sweep: 162 relay tests pass (`cargo test -p phantom-relay -- --test-threads=1`).
4. **Trek 2 Stage 2B-A client shell scope merged** — PR #304, master `9c02a3c8`. New scope doc `docs/tracks/trek2-stage2b-a-client-shell.md` (165 lines). Seven binding client locks L1-L7: LP+PP headers gated on `LONGPOLL_V2_ENABLED == "1"` (both together, no LP-alone or PP-alone client posture) / read-timeout raised IFF flag-on AND `pollHoldSecs in 1..480` (safety margin `[2, 8]s`) / `wsActivePollJob` runs in PARALLEL with WS (lifecycle on transport/session owner, NOT WS-down fallback, MUST NOT replace Direct WSS fast path) / `since_seq` read-only / `seq_mac` presence-parse only NO verify, MUST NOT advance cursor on unverified MAC / release BuildConfig pin `"0"` + M4 contract test / out-of-scope MAC-verify + breaker + reauth-on-410 + voice-media-padding + Tor-Ghost. 3-commit boundary B1 headers+flag / B2 timeout-gate / B3 parallel-job+DTO. 7 contract tests M1-M7. Server contract surface (7 points) verified against `e3794e6e` at scope-doc time — implementation PR MUST re-verify against current master at start; pause if drift. WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out OK (shell-only, release pin); Tele2 LTE smoke gate transfers to Stage 2B-B which DOES exercise the runtime path and is NOT waivable there.

**Why this delivery order:** Strategic frame locked — the long-poll backbone is what makes the messenger un-killable at the product level even when WS or Reality misbehaves. Once the backbone is delivering messages reliably, Direct WSS can be hardened as the fast path without risk to product availability. If the work had gone in the opposite order (Direct/Reality first, backbone after), the messenger would stay fragile on RU mobile through every pcap-chasing iteration.

**Operator action required for Stage 1.x deployment:** provision `RELAY_SEQ_MAC_KEY` (64-hex from `openssl rand -hex 32`) in VPS `.env` BEFORE redeploying the relay with #303. Relay fails to start without the key. `RELAY_POLL_HOLD_SECS=0` remains the production default kill switch — Stage 2B-B will open the kill switch once the client side is widely rolled out.

**Key commits:** `df082528` (Trek 1 V3 closure), `e3794e6e` (Stage 1.x SHIPPED #303), `9c02a3c8` (Stage 2B-A scope merged #304).

**Follow-ups:**

- Stage 2B-A implementation PR — fresh branch `feat/pr-trek2-stage2b-a-client-shell` from current master; strictly inside L1-L7; re-verify the 7 server-contract points first.
- Stage 2B-B (semantic side: MAC verify + cursor advancement + circuit breaker + reauth-on-410) — opens after 2B-A merges. Tele2 LTE smoke mandatory.
- Stage 2B-C — docs cleanup after 2B-B.
- After backbone is done: Direct WSS hardening → Reality Android repair (RC-LIBXRAY-REALITY-WIRE1) → Tor/Ghost polish.

### 2026-06-05 · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 §14 Arm G mini-lock — Reality-tunneled WS heartbeat diagnostic (PR-G1 docs-only)

Docs-only PR locking the Arm G design in `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §14, after Council on §13 T2 Outcome. Arm G is the final cheap micro-experiment from the §4 Arm A.2 Outcome carry-forward and the §13 T2 Outcome carry-forward — wraps the same WS+Text heartbeat that Arm A.2 / Arm D ran bare through Caddy / stunnel inside an outer Reality+VLESS tunnel terminated at the Stage 5E `:8443` endpoint, and asks whether the kill that took down Arm A.2 (control/application asymmetry through stunnel) and T2 (long-connection-uplink failure at ~5 KB through Caddy) survives when the underlay is Reality instead of bare TLS.

**Locked design (7 Council decisions + 4 code-state notes verified against master `d0f41fbe`):**

1. **Clean transport isolation, NOT structural bootstrap isolation.** Arm G short-circuits BEFORE production `transport.connect(...)`, so no production WS connects to relay in parallel. **However**, `container.initMessagingFromStorage()` and `service.startReceiving()` run BEFORE any diagnostic arm short-circuit at [PhantomMessagingService.kt:344-393](apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/service/PhantomMessagingService.kt#L344-L393), so MessagingService internal state may still generate `prekey_publish` / `rest_session_issued` traffic on short-lived REST connections. This is the same surface T2 hit per §13 Outcome isolation caveat. Mitigation: PR-G2 documents the carve-out in the diagnostic class file header AND in the Service short-circuit comment block; PR-G3 outcome capture grep-verifies the absence (or, if present, the count + timing) of `PREKEY_TRACE` / `REST_TRACE` / `prekey_publish` / `rest_session_issued` in both Tecno logcat (UTF-8-decoded per §13 T2 Outcome UTF-16 mismatch lesson) and relay log over the Arm G capture window. If hits are absent → unqualified isolation wording. If hits are present → verdict carries the same concurrent-bootstrap caveat T2 did.
2. **Reuse production `xrayService` singleton** from a debug-only Arm G harness. Production lazy at `AppContainer.kt:649-653` already wraps `OperatorXrayConfig.toConfig(dataDir, socksPort = pickFreeLoopbackPort())`. Singleton is safe to reuse because the only other materialiser is `xrayServiceProvider = { xrayService }` lambda passed to `TransportManager` at `AppContainer.kt:676`, and `TransportManager` is reached only via production `transport.connect(...)` — which Arm G short-circuits before. Conditions: Arm G short-circuits before production transport AND calls `xrayService.stop()` in teardown.
3. **SOCKS port dynamic, NOT hardcoded `10808`.** Arm G must NOT contain `localhost:10808` anywhere. Port comes from `XrayState.Ready(socksPort)` at `XrayState.kt:32`. Reason at `OperatorXrayConfig.kt:43-49`: cross-device test 2026-05-10 hit `bind: address already in use` when V2RayNG / Outline / shadowsocks-android already held 10808.
4. **`Ready(socksPort)` wait uses `withTimeout(15_000L)`.** Stage 5E observed time-to-Ready ~2-3 sec; 15 sec = 5× margin. On timeout, Arm G logs `RC_DIRECT_ARM_G_xray_ready_timeout outcome=xray_not_ready` and terminates WITHOUT attempting WS connect — prevents an indefinitely-hanging foreground session.
5. **Echo round-trips REQUIRED for PASS, NOT lifetime alone.** WS that lives ≥ 10 min but never delivers a single `RC_DIRECT_ARM_G_echo_received` is NOT a PASS (Arm A.2 already showed lifetime ≥ Mode 2 with 0 echoes; Arm D before that showed control/application asymmetry). PASS requires BOTH (lifetime ≥ 10 min sustained) AND (relay `event=heartbeat_echo_received` AND client `RC_DIRECT_ARM_G_echo_received`).
6. **15-minute field run on Tecno + Tele2 LTE.** 10 min = minimum discriminator (Mode 2 baseline lifetime ~45 sec × ~13 reconnects = clear Mode 2 signature within 10 min if it fires); 15 min = locked duration for stronger confidence.
7. **Split PR structure: G1 docs-only mini-lock (this PR) / G2 Android code / G3 outcome docs.** Firmer than §13 T2 single-PR because Arm G introduces first SOCKS5-proxied diagnostic surface AND first reuse-of-production-XrayService pattern in a debug path — both surfaces want explicit pre-code review.

**Hard gates for PR-G2 review (9 invariants in §14):** `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_G_VIA_REALITY == "1"` strict parse; production stack untouched (`RELAY_URL` / `RelayTransportFactory.kt` / `TransportManager` / `KtorRelayTransport`); xray logs redacted (no UUID / shortId / publicKey / signed-challenge token); server-side zero changes (reuses Stage 5E `:8443`); xray lifecycle structured logs (`start_requested` / `ready socksPort=N` / `ready_timeout` / `stop_done` / `failed message_class=N`); `Inv-ParallelArmIsolation` enforced (no parallel production transport); precedence slot between Arm D and production fall-through; teardown calls BOTH `rcDirectArmG?.stop()` AND `xrayService.stop()`; fail-fast on `xray_not_ready` / `xray_failed` / WS pre-onOpen error / echo gaps / silent reconnect storm.

**Discriminator — three locked outcomes:**

- **PASS** (lifetime ≥ 10 min + echo round-trips + no Mode 2) → Reality-primary realtime for RU mobile + 3.2b.1 safety net → ~3-4 weeks impl.
- **PARTIAL** (lifetime ≥ 10 min + echo fails) → REST + Matrix-style long-poll primary + Reality as REST-fallback safety net → ~6-8 weeks impl.
- **FAIL** (Mode 2 persists OR byte-budget class persists) → pure REST + Matrix-style 25-sec long-poll (Option A), abandon Direct WS concept → ~6-8 weeks impl.

**Wording bounds locked:** does NOT claim Reality is the solution; does NOT claim Reality definitely buffers carrier inspection well enough for WS heartbeat (Stage 5E.B.5 validated for HTTP, not inner-WS pattern); does NOT claim FAIL = REST is the only path forever (future Reality protocol upgrade Vision / XHTTP / mux could re-open the question); does NOT make the 1-week time-box a hard-stop (§15 mini-lock extension allowed if PR-G2 review surfaces real blocker).

**5-step plan progress (next step = step 4 PR-G2 code):**

1. ✅ Arm A.2 outcome (PR #291 master `d2c22cd8`).
2. ✅ VPS tear-down of stunnel-arm-a2 + heartbeat_echo revert.
3. ✅ T2 diagnostic (PR #292 `a58ec03f`) + T2 outcome (PR #293 `d0f41fbe`).

  - All 8 `T2_SLOW_POST_chunk_sent` fired in linear sequence: seq=1 `total_sent=5120 elapsed_ms=344` at `05:35:15.154` through seq=8 `total_sent=40960 elapsed_ms=70365` at `05:36:25.175`

- PREKEY_TRACE response-direction failure on Android (NEW finding, not in initial PR #293 body): `prekey_publish_start attempt=1/3` at `05:35:14.810` (`bodyBytes=5863`), then `W prekey_publish_retry reason=SocketTimeoutException attempt=1 elapsedMs=60580` at `05:36:15.397`; attempt 2 starts at `05:36:15.901`, retries at `05:37:16.761` with `elapsedMs=60853`; attempt 3 starts at `05:37:18.265` (terminal state not in captured window). The client wrote the request body, the relay processed it (per the three server-side `prekey_publish` events), but the response did not return to the client within OkHttp's read window for attempts 1 and 2. This indicates the byte-budget / duration-budget class behaviour extends to the **response direction on sufficiently long-held connections**, not just the upload direction observed on T2.

**Verdict:**

- **Relay received 5120 of 40960 bytes (12.5%); Android `total_sent=40960` (OkHttp queue-accepted all 8 chunks via per-chunk `sink.flush()`).** Chunks 2-8 of the request body never physically reached the relay despite Android's `RequestBody.writeTo()` having completed successfully. The gap between `total_sent=40960` and `total_received=5120` IS the discriminator the locked design anticipated under hard gate 2 ("`write()` proves only OkHttp queue-accept; physical egress is what the test actually measures").
- **Server-side ingestion of concurrent short bodies was uniformly UNAFFECTED through the same Caddy + Tele2 LTE path during the same 163-second window.** Three `/prekeys/publish` request bodies (5863 bytes each) and one `/auth/session` request body reached relay and were processed normally. **Client-side response reception was NOT uniformly successful**, however: `/auth/session` returned 200 to the Android client (rest_session bootstrapped), but `/prekeys/publish` attempts 1 and 2 failed with `prekey_publish_retry reason=SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=60580/60853` on the Android side — the request body wrote, the relay processed it, but the response did not return within OkHttp's `readTimeout=60s` window. This is consistent with byte-budget / duration-budget class behaviour extending to the response direction on sufficiently long-held connections, not just the upload direction.
- **Byte-threshold hypothesis class directionally confirmed. Observed upload-direction abort point is SIGNIFICANTLY EARLIER than the documented `net4people/bbs #490` 14-32 KB range — 5120 bytes on this carrier / device / hour.** Honest framing: the external 14-32 KB class hypothesis is directionally confirmed, the magnitude does not match; this strengthens rather than weakens the architectural implication (bare Direct mobile uplink is even less viable than the published threshold suggested). The PREKEY_TRACE response-direction failures add a second strengthening signal that the kill class affects the response path on long-held connections too.

**Isolation caveat (honest).** T2 was NOT a sole-connection field test. The relay log AND the Tecno logcat both show the diagnostic POST ran concurrently with production bootstrap traffic from the same install (prekey publish + auth/session issuance after onboarding). The discriminator still holds — server-side short-body ingestion was uniformly unaffected while the long-held T2 POST stalled at ~5 KB — but I cannot rule out that the precise abort-byte-count (5120) interacted with the simultaneous short-POST traffic on adjacent TCP connections that may share carrier-allocated TCP/PDP context. Verdict is therefore "byte-threshold class confirmed" not "exact threshold 5120 ± ε confirmed."

**Wording bounds (carried forward from Arm A.2 Outcome and locked here).** Does NOT claim "`net4people` exact threshold confirmed on Tele2." Does NOT claim "hypotheses 1/2/3/4 refuted" — the asymmetry continuation from Arm D and Arm A.2 Outcomes (relay sees WS Control Ping but not WS Text echo from the same wall-clock instant) is orthogonal to the long-POST byte-budget failure and may still be live. Does NOT claim "Direct WS is unfixable" — Arm G discriminates whether wrapping in Reality changes the answer.

**Architectural implication: bare Direct uplink is demoted as primary realtime path on RU mobile.** This is NOT a WS-specific finding — it is a long-connection-uplink finding that subsumes the WS-specific Arm A.2 and Arm D verdicts. Any long-held connection on Tele2 LTE uplink is structurally untrustworthy, regardless of whether it carries WS frames, SSE chunks, or chunked HTTP body. §5 decision-tree row "Y met → uplift realtime per ADR-028" continues to fire; T2 strengthens the architectural component (long SSE responses through Caddy would also die at the byte threshold; Matrix-style 25-second long-poll becomes the mandatory primary REST realtime pattern; inside Reality must also use short-cycle framing such as mux / XHTTP).

**5-step plan progress (next step = step 4):**

1. ✅ Arm A.2 outcome docs-only PR — locked Y verdict, did NOT close track. Master `d2c22cd8`.
2. ✅ VPS tear-down of stunnel-arm-a2 + `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1` revert.
3. ✅ T2 slow POST diagnostic — PR #292 squash `a58ec03f` (code) + this PR (outcome docs).
4. ⚡ Pending — Arm G WS-over-Reality (next session): new `RcDirectArmG.kt` near-clone of `RcDirectArmD` routed through embedded libXray SOCKS5 listener (`localhost:10808`, already Stage 5E production-validated for Reality outer transport) → external `:8443` Reality endpoint (production endpoint + UUID from existing `OperatorXrayConfig.kt`) → relay. Same heartbeat payload, same `Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame`, same lifecycle fixes. 10-15 min Tele2 LTE field test. Discriminator: Reality WS holds ≥ 10 min with echo round-trips succeeding → Reality-primary realtime for RU mobile; Reality WS dies same Mode 2 → kill is below all transport layers → pure REST + Matrix-style long-poll. Hard time-box remains 1 week from §4 Arm A.2 Outcome PR landing.
5. Pending — final outcome PR + Council on architecture pivot.

**Operator-owned next steps (pre-merge of this PR):**

1. SSH to VPS: idempotent revert of `RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=1` from `/home/phantom/Phantom/deploy/.env` via `sed -i 's/^RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=1$/# RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=0  # T2 closed 2026-06-05/' .env`.
2. `docker compose up -d --force-recreate relay`; verify `slow_post_diag_enabled=false` in startup log; verify `POST /diag/slow-post` returns 404.
3. xray REALITY production on `:8443` remains untouched — Stage 5E.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out.** Docs + memory only. No Android transport code touched. Production paths unchanged.

**WORKING_RULES rule 9.** All concrete claims grep- or log-verified: relay log paths quoted verbatim from `C:\temp\t2-relay-window.log`; Tecno logcat claims verified after re-encoding the UTF-16 LE capture to UTF-8 (`C:\temp\t2-tecno-tele2-utf8.log`) — the full T2_SLOW_POST timeline is present (8 `T2_SLOW_POST_chunk_sent` events from seq=1 `total_sent=5120` through seq=8 `total_sent=40960`, terminal `T2_SLOW_POST_failed t=SocketTimeoutException total_sent=40960 elapsed_ms=130377`) plus the PREKEY_TRACE response-direction failure trail (attempts 1 + 2 hit `prekey_publish_retry reason=SocketTimeoutException`). The initial PR #293 body wrongly claimed "zero matches" due to a UTF-16-vs-ASCII grep mismatch on my side; fixed in fixup commit `e671512a`.

### 2026-06-06 (sat, afternoon) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 §13 T2 — slow-POST byte-threshold diagnostic (relay handler + Android one-shot + preflight uploader + mini-lock)

Single PR shipping the §13 T2 mini-lock and code together (smaller scope than the PR-6/PR-7 split because no reconnect loop and no paired state machine). Discriminates hypothesis 5 (`net4people/bbs Issue #490` cumulative-bytes-per-TCP-connection-freeze, 14-32 KB threshold on RU mobile operators) from the other four hypotheses in the Arm D / Arm A.2 outcome open set.

**Vladislav-locked 5 hard gates + 4 additions (all reflected in code, mini-lock, and preflight):**

1. **Separate OkHttp profile for T2**: `connectTimeout=5s`, `writeTimeout=30s`, `readTimeout=60s`, `callTimeout=180s`. The WebSocket arms' `callTimeout(10s)` would kill the slow POST before threshold detection. Hard gate baked into `T2SlowPostDiag.kt` builder — do NOT copy from `RcDirectArmA2.kt` or `RcDirectArmD.kt`.
2. **Primary discriminator = relay `total_received`, NOT Android `total_sent`.** `write()` proves only OkHttp queue-accept; physical egress is what the test actually measures. Verdict counter is the relay-side `event=slow_post_chunk_received total_bytes=N` log + `event=slow_post_aborted total_bytes=N reason=...` at failure.
3. **Caddy streaming preflight required BEFORE field test.** Operator runs `python scripts/t2-slow-post-preflight.py --url https://relay.phntm.pro/diag/slow-post` from Windows/WSL and watches relay docker logs in parallel. Pass: chunks appear progressively every ~10 s. Fail: chunks all clustered at end → Caddy buffering. Explicit Python uploader instead of `curl --limit-rate` because the latter smooths the throttle but doesn't guarantee discrete chunks with explicit per-chunk flush.
4. **Body locked at `40960 = 8 × 5120` bytes**, 10 s between chunks, total ~70-80 s. Spans the documented 14-32 KB threshold range with margin. Default-off env flag `RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=1` (strict `== "1"` parse); cap 64 KB; required headers `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` AND `X-Phantom-Diag: slow-post-v1` (anti-stray-POST guard). When flag false, route NOT registered → 404 (Vladislav addition B: route off → 404, not live-405).
5. **Service wire-up is ONE-SHOT, NOT reconnect loop.** T2 is structurally different from the WS arms — one POST, log outcome, terminate. Service stays alive (foreground host) but the diagnostic itself is finished. Re-running requires app restart.

Additions A/B/C/D (carried through):
- A. Idempotent preflight: locked Python uploader, not `curl --limit-rate`.
- B. Route off → 404, defence-in-depth.
- C. Per-chunk log structure mirrors PR-6 pattern.
- D. Single PR (smaller scope than Arm D's PR-6/PR-7 split).

**Discriminator — three locked outcomes:**

| Relay outcome | Hypothesis verdict | Architectural implication |
|---|---|---|
| `total_received` 14-32 KB + `event=slow_post_aborted` | `net4people #490` byte-threshold strongly confirmed | Matrix-style 25-sec long-poll mandatory primary; long SSE dies; inside Reality must use short-cycle (mux/XHTTP) |
| `total_received` > 32 KB but < 40 KB + abort | Same class, different threshold value | Same as above |
| `total_received` = 40 960 + `200 OK` | Byte-threshold refuted on HTTP POST through Caddy | Arm G (WS-over-Reality) is primary next test |

**Wording bound.** "Refuted on HTTP POST through Caddy" does NOT mean "refuted globally" — WS-over-Caddy may hit a different mechanism (the Arm D / Arm A.2 asymmetry continuation is one such candidate). Arm G follows regardless of T2's outcome.

**Files shipped (this PR):**

- `services/relay/src/config.rs` — new `slow_post_diag_enabled: bool` field with strict `RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG="1"` parse; `from_env_for_test()` defaults to `false`; debug fmt extended.
- `services/relay/src/main.rs` — startup log line extended to include `slow_post_diag_enabled` flag state.
- `services/relay/src/routes.rs` — new `slow_post_diag` handler (~140 LOC including doc comment): streams body via `Body::into_data_stream()` using `futures_util::StreamExt`, logs `event=slow_post_chunk_received` per chunk + terminal `event=slow_post_completed` or `event=slow_post_aborted reason=...`, validates `X-Phantom-Diag: slow-post-v1` AND `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` BEFORE reading body, caps at 64 KB. Route registration is conditional — when flag false, route NOT mounted → 404. Route is mounted AFTER the 30-second `TimeoutLayer` so it runs without the standard timeout (T2 POST takes ~70-80 s by design).
- `services/relay/tests/slow_post_diag.rs` — 6 integration tests (all passing): route returns 404 when flag off; missing `X-Phantom-Diag` → 400; wrong header value → 400; wrong content-type → 400; cap exceeded → 413; happy path returns 200 with correct `total_received` JSON.
- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/diagnostic/T2SlowPostDiag.kt` (NEW, ~210 LOC) — one-shot diagnostic class. Custom `RequestBody` writes 8 × 5120 bytes chunks with `sink.flush()` after each chunk and `Thread.sleep(10_000)` between chunks. Logs `T2_SLOW_POST_chunk_sent seq=N total_sent=N` per chunk (secondary client counter) + terminal `T2_SLOW_POST_completed` / `_non_2xx` / `_failed`. Own OkHttpClient profile per Vladislav hard gate 1.
- `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` — new `DEBUG_T2_SLOW_POST_URL` BuildConfig field via `localOrEnv("debugT2SlowPostUrl", ...)`; release block pins to `""` for defence-in-depth.
- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/di/AppContainer.kt` — new `t2SlowPostDiag` lazy field, gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_T2_SLOW_POST_URL.isNotEmpty()`.
- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/service/PhantomMessagingService.kt` — short-circuit branch between Arm A.2 and Arm B (precedence A → A.2 → **T2** → B → C → D → production); one-shot start (no reconnect loop); matching teardown in `onDestroy`.
- `scripts/t2-slow-post-preflight.py` (NEW, ~160 LOC) — Python preflight uploader that opens raw TCP/TLS socket, writes HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer-encoding framing manually with explicit `sock.sendall()` per chunk and `time.sleep(10)` between chunks. Pass criterion: relay logs chunks progressively. Fail criterion: clustered at end (Caddy buffering).
- `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` — new §13 T2 mini-lock subsection appended (~120 lines): goal, why-POST-not-WS, refined scope with 5 hard gates + 4 additions explicitly listed, three-outcome discriminator with wording bound, 8-step setup including operator-owned preflight + field test + revert.
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` — this entry.
- `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` — Last-updated bump + Shipped list extension through PR #291 plus this PR.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out (T2 PR).** New Android transport-adjacent code (`T2SlowPostDiag.kt` + Service wire-up) but debug-only, gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_T2_SLOW_POST_URL.isNotEmpty()`. Production code paths (`transport.connect`, `KtorRelayTransport`, `TransportManager`) are unchanged. Smoke-test substitute: `./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDebug` → BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 53s with `debugT2SlowPostUrl=""` default, confirms production path still compiles. Same carve-out pattern as PR #290 (PR-8b).

**WORKING_RULES rule 9.** Every code-state claim grep- or test-verified. Relay handler validated by 6 integration tests covering all error paths + happy path. Android build verified. Vladislav 5 hard gates documented inline at decision sites (T2 OkHttp builder comment + AppContainer wire-up comment + Service short-circuit comment).

**Vladislav-locked 5-step plan progress (current step = step 3):**

1. ✅ Arm A.2 outcome docs-only PR — locked verdict, did NOT close track. Master `d2c22cd8`.
2. ✅ VPS tear-down — `compose stop stunnel-arm-a2 + rm -f`; reverted `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1`; `/health` ok; xray REALITY `:8443` untouched.
3. ⚡ T2 slow POST diagnostic (this PR) — relay handler + Android one-shot + preflight uploader + §13 mini-lock.
4. Pending — Arm G WS-over-Reality (after T2 field test result).
5. Pending — final outcome PR + Council on architecture pivot.

**Operator-owned next steps after this PR merges:**

1. VPS: `git pull`; idempotent `RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=1` flip in `.env`; `compose up -d --force-recreate relay`; verify `slow_post_diag_enabled=true` in startup log.
2. Caddy streaming preflight from Windows/WSL: `python scripts/t2-slow-post-preflight.py --url https://relay.phntm.pro/diag/slow-post`; parallel SSH tail of relay docker logs; verify chunks appear progressively (pass) vs clustered at end (fail).
3. If preflight PASSES: assistant builds debug APK with `debugT2SlowPostUrl=https://relay.phntm.pro/diag/slow-post` in `local.properties`; Vladislav installs on Tecno; opens app; lets onboarding create identity; returns to home screen; Service automatically triggers T2; parallel relay docker logs capture for 90 sec window; logcat for `RC_DIRECT_*` and `T2_SLOW_POST` tags.
4. If preflight FAILS (Caddy buffering): operator either tunes Caddy or aborts T2 through Caddy and decides next path.
5. After field test: revert `RELAY_ENABLE_SLOW_POST_DIAG=1` from `.env`; recreate relay; verify `slow_post_diag_enabled=false`.

CHIP1 stays parked at `78bd979e`. 3.2b.1 stays unfrozen but parked behind final RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 outcome per `Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence` — escalates to "needed" per §5 row A.2 X firing (already locked in PR #291 outcome).

### 2026-06-06 (sat) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 outcome — Y verdict with persistent control/application asymmetry continuation; track does NOT close, T2 byte-threshold + Arm G Reality-WS micro-experiments precede final close (1-week time-box)

Docs-only PR locking the Arm A.2 field test verdict in `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2 Outcome subsection. Does NOT close the track — Vladislav-locked refined plan after four-architect external review 2026-06-05 carries forward two cheap micro-experiments before final close.

**Field run (Tecno Tele2 LTE 2026-06-05 ~01:00 — ~01:16 local, 15-min capture, PR-8b APK `phantom-arma2.apk` SHA `17fec82e783107fac09621c4ef9d47d581b883fe27dd88003eb214b5499fed2f`):**

- Client log: 21 ws_open / 20 ws_failure / 40 echo_sent events / **0** echo_received / 0 heartbeat_sender exceptions
- Relay log: 20 ws_protocol_ping_received / 20 ws_protocol_pong_sent / **0** event=heartbeat_echo_received (per-frame log at `services/relay/src/routes.rs:523`)
- Mode 2 carrier signature byte-perfect identical to Arm D (s=1: 30 004 ms / 0 successful pongs; s=2..s=20: ~45 008 ms / 1 successful pong)
- Control/application asymmetry persists through `:8444` (Ping arrives at relay app layer, Text never does)

**Two different TLS stacks (Caddy Go TLS vs stunnel OpenSSL 3.3.7) + two different proxy paths → byte-identical death.** The proximal cause is NOT the edge stack.

**Verdict per §5 + §6 + §4 Arm A.2 Discriminator W/X/Y:**

- **W refuted** — WS lifetime not extended (median ~45 s vs ≥ 90 s threshold); Mode 2 signature persists; echo round-trips never succeed.
- **X met** — asymmetry persists Ping vs Text. Caddy loses priority as proximal cause.
- **Y met** — Mode 2 signature persists through `:8444`. Structural carrier / path / lower-layer kill.
- **Honest synthesis:** "Y with persistent control/application asymmetry continuation."

**Wording bounds locked:** does NOT claim "Caddy innocent" / "carrier discriminates" / "TLS broken" / "WebSocket broken". Five-hypothesis open set respected.

**Hypothesis-set update — Arm D four-hypothesis set EXTENDED to FIVE** after Independent Audit input 2026-06-05:

1. OkHttp writer-side enqueue-vs-egress timing
2. Caddy/TLS WS frame handling (Arm A.2 refutes this as proximal)
3. Carrier path stateful inspection
4. Interaction across layers 1-3
5. **NEW: Cumulative-bytes-per-TCP-connection freeze (~14-32 KB threshold).** Documented in `net4people/bbs Issue #490` (hyperion-cs, 2025-06-27) and Runnin4ik's dpi-detector CLI. Mechanism explains: linear lifetime ≈ 3× ping_interval, Ping (6B) vs Text (50B+) asymmetry, per-connection reset, Mode 2 signature shape.

T2 micro-experiment directly discriminates hypothesis 5.

**External architecture review consumed (four independent architects + working architect, 2026-06-05):**

- **Gemini** — close immediately + Option A. Too quick, did not know Reality is production-validated.
- **Claude Code in-chat** — Arm G (Reality-tunneled WS) before close.
- **Claude Code Independent Audit (most substantive 38KB document)** — introduces byte-threshold hypothesis missed in my own open set + concrete T2/Arm G designs + Reality+SSE as layers not alternatives + QUIC blocked in RU per YARA-rule do-not-pursue.
- **Working architect** — Arm G primary discriminator before close + decision tree from result.
- **ChatGPT Executive Summary docx** — off-track (analyses old PR-RECV-DIAG1 v1.6 sticky lastWorkingTransport + MAC error + ack_deliver problem; not current Direct WS / Tele2 track; backlog).
- **Convergence:** bare Direct WSS no longer single foundation of realtime; ADR-028 4-layer architecture intent is correct path.
- **Vladislav-locked refinement:** T2+Arm G both before final close (T2 cheaper sharper discriminator; Arm G follows). Hard time-box 1 week.

**Five-step plan (current step = step 1):**

1. **Arm A.2 outcome docs-only PR (this PR)** — locks verdict in track doc; does NOT close track.
2. **VPS tear-down** — `compose stop stunnel-arm-a2 + rm -f`; revert `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1` from `.env`. xray REALITY `:8443` untouched.
3. **T2 slow POST diagnostic (~1 day)** — relay endpoint `/diag/slow-post` (default-off env flag); Android `T2SlowPostDiag.kt` sends 40 KB chunked (5 KB per 10 s, total 90 s). Discriminator: dies at 14-32 KB → byte-threshold confirmed → Matrix-style 25-sec long-poll mandatory.
4. **Arm G WS-over-Reality (~2-3 days)** — Android `RcDirectArmG.kt` routes through embedded libXray SOCKS5 `localhost:10808` → `:8443` Reality endpoint → relay. 10-15 min Tele2 LTE field test. Discriminator: holds ≥ 10 min → Reality-primary realtime for RU mobile.
5. **Final outcome PR + Council on architecture pivot** (~1-2 days).

**Decision tree after T2 + Arm G:**

| T2 | Arm G | Architectural pivot |
|---|---|---|
| any | holds ≥ 10 min | Reality-tunneled realtime primary. Cost ~3-4 weeks. |
| 14-32 KB freeze | dies | Matrix-style 25-sec long-poll mandatory + REST. Cost ~6-8 weeks. |

CHIP1 stays parked at `78bd979e`. 3.2b.1 stays unfrozen but parked behind RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 outcome per `Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence` — escalates to "needed" per §5 row A.2 X firing.

### 2026-06-05 (fri, very late) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8b — Android `RcDirectArmA2.kt` diagnostic class + `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL` BuildConfig + AppContainer/Service wire-up at precedence A → A.2 → B → C → D → production

Android client PR for Arm A.2 after the server-side bypass chain (#286 + #287 + #288 + #289) landed and deploy-verified on VPS 2026-06-05 (TLS 1.3 + relay `401 Unauthorized` through stunnel `:8444`).

**RcDirectArmA2.kt** — near-clone of `RcDirectArmD.kt`. Same raw OkHttp pattern, same `OkHttpClient.Builder()` parameters (`pingInterval(15s)`, `readTimeout(60s)`, `connectTimeout(5s)`, `callTimeout(10s)`, `protocols(HTTP_1_1)`), same `WebSocketListener` telemetry shape, same reconnect loop. Same heartbeat sender pattern: emits one Text frame matching `phantom:diagnostic:heartbeat-echo:v1:<seq>:<client_ms>` every 15 s after `onOpen`, counts inbound Text frames matching the same prefix as echoes returned by the relay's PR #279 handler. Same `SEND_TIME_MAP_CAPACITY = 32` bounded map for RTT computation.

**Lifecycle fixes carried in from PR #276 + #280:**

- `currentWebSocket` nulled in `onClosed` + `onFailure` (PR #276 shield #1) and in `runOneSession.finally` (shield #2)
- `openedAt: CompletableDeferred<Long>` completed in `onOpen` with wall-clock millis; `completeExceptionally(...)` from `onClosed`/`onFailure` if session ends before `onOpen` so the heartbeat coroutine unblocks cleanly (PR #280 P1)
- Heartbeat coroutine: `if (t is CancellationException) throw t` BEFORE generic `Throwable` catch so cooperative cancellation does not log a spurious warning per session close (PR #280 P2)

**Path difference from Arm D, NOT logic difference.** Arm D targets production `BuildConfig.RELAY_URL` (`wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws` through Caddy on host `:443`). Arm A.2 targets `BuildConfig.DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL` (`wss://relay.phntm.pro:8444/ws` through stunnel on host `:8444`). Same hostname, different host-network-layer port, different edge stack (Caddy HTTP/WS proxy vs stunnel raw TCP forward). The carrier path (Tele2 LTE radio + middleboxes) and the device OkHttp stack stay identical. The W/X/Y discriminator reads:

- **W** — stunnel sustains the WS ≥ 3× Tele2 baseline + Text echoes succeed → Caddy edge path is in the kill chain or contributes (does NOT prove TLS innocent)
- **X** — Ping survives, Text dies (Arm D asymmetry persists through `:8444`) → asymmetry origin below Caddy edge or in a layer Caddy and stunnel share
- **Y** — Mode 2 signature persists through `:8444` → Caddy strongly loses priority; carrier/path/lower-layer kill

**BuildConfig wire-up (Vladislav-locked gates):**

- `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL` debug field — read via `localOrEnv("debugRcDirectArmA2Url", "DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL", "")`, defaults to `""`
- Release block: `buildConfigField("String", "DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL", "\"\"")` — defence-in-depth pin
- AppContainer `rcDirectArmA2` lazy field gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG && BuildConfig.DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL.isNotEmpty()` — null in release builds even if the field were corrupted
- Service short-circuit branch in `onStartCommand` — same double gate, returns before `transport.connect(...)` so production Hybrid Ktor path never runs in parallel with Arm A.2 (Inv-ParallelArmIsolation)
- Service teardown in `onDestroy` — same double gate, `runCatching { container.rcDirectArmA2?.stop() }` mirroring Arms A/B/C/D pattern

**Precedence locked per §7 step 5e:** Arm A (Caddy-bypass loopback URL) → Arm A.2 (public non-Caddy TLS bypass URL via stunnel `:8444`) → Arm B (raw OkHttp baseline through Caddy `:443`) → Arm C (ping interval matrix) → Arm D (heartbeat echo) → production. Only ONE arm runs per build because the BuildConfig gates are sequential `if` blocks — Arms A and A.2 both use `DEBUG_*_URL.isNotEmpty()` gates and are mutually exclusive in practice (a build sets one or the other).

**Vladislav-locked review gates — all PASS:**

| Gate | Verification |
|---|---|
| Production `BuildConfig.RELAY_URL` not touched | `git diff apps/android/build.gradle.kts` shows zero `RELAY_URL` changes |
| `RelayTransportFactory.kt:71` not touched | File not in `git status` modified list |
| Release build cannot enable Arm A.2 | `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL.isNotEmpty()` double gate + release block pins field to `""` for defence-in-depth |
| No accidental production path | Service short-circuit returns before `transport.connect(...)` |
| Outbound Text heartbeat only, no custom Ping/Pong | Single `ws.send()` call site (line 304) with payload from `HEARTBEAT_ECHO_PREFIX` constant; OkHttp internal `pingInterval(15s)` handles WS control Ping/Pong (not our code); `Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame` held |
| Lifecycle stop/cancel clean | PR #276 shield #1 (`currentWebSocket` null in `onClosed`/`onFailure`) + shield #2 (`runOneSession.finally`) + PR #280 P1 (`openedAt.completeExceptionally(...)` on pre-`onOpen` failure) + PR #280 P2 (`CancellationException` rethrow in heartbeat coroutine) all preserved verbatim from Arm D |
| Build passes | `./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDebug` → `BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 51s` |

**Files updated (this PR):**

- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/diagnostic/RcDirectArmA2.kt` (NEW) — near-clone of `RcDirectArmD.kt` with TAG `RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2`, surgical doc-comment changes referencing §4 Arm A.2 W/X/Y discriminator + PR-8a server-side dependency state + cumulative fixup chain history. Class is `internal` to the diagnostic package.
- `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` — new `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL` field in debug block (via `localOrEnv`) + release block defence-in-depth pin to `""`.
- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/di/AppContainer.kt` — new `rcDirectArmA2` lazy field gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG && BuildConfig.DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL.isNotEmpty()`.
- `apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/service/PhantomMessagingService.kt` — Arm A.2 short-circuit branch inserted between Arm A and Arm B (precedence A → A.2 → B → C → D → production) + matching teardown in `onDestroy`.
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` — this entry.
- `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` — Last-updated bump + Shipped list extension through PR #289 plus this PR.

**What this PR does NOT do:**

- NO production code change — relay binary unchanged, production transport stack unchanged.
- NO `:8444` URL in production code paths.
- NO modifications to `RelayTransportFactory.kt`, `KtorRelayTransport`, `TransportManager`, or any non-diagnostic Android transport code.
- NO APK built and shipped — APK build follows after merge per `feedback_apk_build_is_mine.md` (assistant-owned APK build + adb install commands for Vladislav-owned field test).

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 (transport regression gate).** PR-8b touches Android transport code (new diagnostic class + Service short-circuit). Per rule 8, this requires Tele2 LTE smoke test before merge OR a documented carve-out. **Carve-out applies** because the changes are debug-only and gated by `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL.isNotEmpty()`; production code paths (transport.connect, KtorRelayTransport, TransportManager) are unchanged. The diagnostic itself IS the field test, run via the APK that ships from this PR. Smoke-test substitute: `./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL — confirms the production path still compiles with the diagnostic class wired in, but BuildConfig set to disabled (`debugRcDirectArmA2Url=""` default).

**WORKING_RULES rule 9 (no merge without verification).** Every code-state claim grep-verified or build-verified: build passes, `git diff` confirms no production RELAY_URL touched, `git status` confirms RelayTransportFactory.kt not modified, single `ws.send()` call site located at line 304 with `HEARTBEAT_ECHO_PREFIX` payload. Architect pre-review not requested for this PR because the diagnostic class is a structural near-clone of `RcDirectArmD` (PR #280 squash `756c0d81` on master) and the path-only change is mechanical from the locked §4 Arm A.2 scope.

**Track sequencing locked:**

- PR-8b (this PR): Android diagnostic code.
- After merge: assistant builds `phantom-arma2.apk` from master with `debugRcDirectArmA2Url=wss://relay.phntm.pro:8444/ws` in `local.properties`, computes SHA, hands adb install commands to Vladislav.
- Field test: Tecno Tele2 LTE 15-min capture through `wss://relay.phntm.pro:8444/ws`. Logcat collection per `feedback_logcat_format.md` to `C:\temp\arm-a2-tecno-tele2.log`. Parallel relay-side `docker logs phantom-relay` capture for `event=heartbeat_echo_received` counter on the `:8444` path.
- Outcome PR (PR-9, docs-only): §4 Arm A.2 Outcome subsection (analogous to Arm C/D outcome subsections) with the W/X/Y verdict. Triggers next track per §5: RC-CADDY-FIX1 (W) / below-edge investigation (X) / Arm F mini-lock (Y).

CHIP1 stays parked at `78bd979e`. 3.2b.1 stays unfrozen but parked per `Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence` — escalates to "needed" only if Arm A.2 closes X.

### 2026-06-05 (fri, late late evening) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8a `clients = 50` drop — directive is global not per-service, fell back to relay-side rate-limit + diagnostic-only safeguards per §4 Arm A.2 Security mini-lock fallback branch

Fourth small fixup PR on top of PR #288 (TLS-options-cleanup squash on master). After PR #288 landed, retried `compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` succeeded at the build step and TLS-option parse step but the container exited again at config-parse:

```
[.] Reading configuration from file /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
[.] Initializing service [relay-arm-a2]
[!] /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:115: "clients = 50": Specified option name is not valid here
[!] Configuration failed
```

**Root cause.** `clients` is a **global** stunnel directive, not a per-service one. The original `stunnel.armA2.conf` from PR-8a (#285) placed it inside the `[relay-arm-a2]` service section — a scope bug that the three earlier deploy failures (entrypoint + TLS-options syntax + Alpine-build) masked until this point.

**Option (B) — drop entirely — chosen over Option (A) — relocate to global section.** Reason (Vladislav-formulated): we have now caught four consecutive deploy-time surprises from stunnel-side config; the time-boxed exposure + TLS-only public endpoint + signed-challenge relay auth (post-stunnel-unwrap) + `restart: "no"` + explicit teardown + non-production `:8444` port are sufficient diagnostic-only safeguards for a 15-min capture window; less stunnel config = less risk of a fifth surprise; if edge-level connection limiting is needed later, implement it explicitly via HAProxy, nftables, or relay-side limits under a separate mini-lock.

**§4 Arm A.2 Security mini-lock not violated.** The clause "Connection cap + per-IP rate-limit at the stunnel level if available, **else at the relay level** (relay's existing rate-limit applies post-stunnel-unwrap)" falls back to the second branch cleanly. The publicly-negotiated minimum is still TLS 1.2, the cipher list and TLS 1.3 cipher suites are unchanged, the cert mount and security posture are unchanged.

**Inline config comment expanded** in `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` to explain why `clients` was dropped + list the substitute diagnostic-only safeguards — so a future maintainer doesn't naively re-add the directive without understanding the fallback rationale.

**Cumulative diagnostic-design-lesson — fourth instance.**

- #286: port availability (host port `:8443` already bound by xray production)
- #287: image entrypoint behaviour (dweomer auto-generates config from env vars, ignores bind-mount)
- #288: TLS-option syntax compatibility (`NO_TLSv1.1` dot invalid; NO_* flags version-fragile in OpenSSL 3.x)
- This PR: stunnel directive scope (global vs per-service — `clients` is global, was placed in service section)

All four are stunnel/OpenSSL/Docker/version-dependent and require either pre-deploy smoke-testing against the target image (e.g., `docker run --rm -v "$PWD/stunnel.armA2.conf:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:ro" phantom-stunnel-arm-a2:latest -test` or equivalent) or first-deploy validation before any scope-lock PR declares them. The PR-8b Android client work that follows is **gated on the operator confirming a green stunnel startup** before any APK is built.

**Files updated (this PR, fixup only):**

- `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` — removed `clients = 50` line + replaced preceding comment with an expanded "No stunnel-level connection cap" block explaining why the directive was dropped and listing the substitute diagnostic-only safeguards (time-box, TLS-only, signed-challenge auth, `restart: "no"`, explicit teardown, non-production port).
- `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record — new "Deploy-time finding — `clients = 50` dropped from stunnel config" bullet (with stunnel.conf:115 error stanza + Option A/B analysis + cumulative-lesson note covering all four fixup PRs + pre-deploy smoke-test process improvement reference); Files shipped section updated to remove the `clients = 50 connection cap` mention from both Dockerfile bullet (which previously referenced it) and stunnel.armA2.conf bullet.
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` — this entry.
- `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` — Last-updated bump + Shipped list extension through PR #288 plus this PR.

**What this PR does NOT change:**

- Port mapping `8444:8443` (host:container) — unchanged from #286.
- Inside-container `accept = 0.0.0.0:8443` — unchanged.

- `sslVersionMin = TLSv1.2` + `sslVersionMax = TLSv1.3` — unchanged from #288.
- Cert volume mount `caddy-data:/data:ro` — unchanged.

- Cipher list (`HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4` + TLS 1.3 cipher suites) — unchanged.
- `pid =` empty (read_only rootfs guard from #287) — unchanged.
- `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO` flag handling — unchanged.
- xray REALITY production binding on `:8443` — completely untouched.
- Production `BuildConfig.RELAY_URL` or `RelayTransportFactory.kt:71` — unchanged.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out (PR-8a `clients` drop).** Server-side only, zero Android transport code touched.

**WORKING_RULES rule 9.** Deploy-time finding documented with verbatim stunnel error log + diagnostic context.

**Track sequencing locked:**

### 2026-06-05 (fri, late evening) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8a TLS-options cleanup — remove four `options = NO_*` lines from stunnel.armA2.conf; `sslVersionMin/Max` directives alone enforce TLS 1.2+

Third small fixup PR on top of PR #287 (Alpine-build squash on master). After PR #287 landed, retried `compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` succeeded at the build step (Alpine-built image cached as `phantom-stunnel-arm-a2:latest`), but the started container exited at config-parse time with:

```
[.] stunnel 5.72 on x86_64-alpine-linux-musl platform
[.] Compiled with OpenSSL 3.3.0 9 Apr 2024
[.] Running  with OpenSSL 3.3.7 7 Apr 2026
[.] Reading configuration from file /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
[.] Initializing service [relay-arm-a2]
[!] /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:93: "options = NO_TLSv1.1": Illegal TLS option
[!] Configuration failed
```

**Root cause.** stunnel option syntax for "disable TLS 1.1" is `NO_TLSv1_1` (underscore), not `NO_TLSv1.1` (dot). The original `stunnel.armA2.conf` from PR-8a (#285) shipped the dot form — a syntax bug that the dweomer-image entrypoint failure (#287) masked until the Alpine-built container actually reached the config-parse phase. Additionally, even the syntactically-correct `NO_SSLv2` / `NO_SSLv3` / `NO_TLSv1` / `NO_TLSv1_1` option flags are largely **redundant** with the modern `sslVersionMin = TLSv1.2` + `sslVersionMax = TLSv1.3` directives also present in the config, and OpenSSL 3.x has removed several legacy option constants entirely — the next NO_* line would likely have been the next minefield.

**Option B (clean) chosen over Option A (surgical syntax fix).** Removed all four `options = NO_*` lines from `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf`. Kept `sslVersionMin = TLSv1.2` + `sslVersionMax = TLSv1.3` which alone enforce the §4 Arm A.2 Security mini-lock "TLS 1.2+ minimum, prefer TLS 1.3" rule cleanly. No security regression — the publicly-negotiated minimum is still TLS 1.2.

**Inline config comment expanded.** Explains why `options = NO_*` flags are intentionally NOT used (version-fragile in OpenSSL 3.x; redundant with `sslVersionMin/Max`); preserves the deploy-finding trail so a future maintainer doesn't naively re-add them.

**Diagnostic-design-lesson cumulative.** Third deploy-time lesson in the PR-8a fixup chain:

- #286: port availability (host port `:8443` already bound by xray production)
- #287: image entrypoint behaviour (dweomer auto-generates config from env vars, ignores bind-mount)
- This PR: TLS-option syntax compatibility (dot vs underscore in `NO_TLSv1.1`; legacy NO_* flags fragile across OpenSSL versions)

All three are VPS-state-or-version-dependent and must be verified before a scope-lock PR declares them. The §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record now carries the cumulative lesson with all three deploy-time finding bullets.

**Files updated (this PR, fixup only):**

- `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` — removed 4 `options = NO_*` lines; updated TLS hardening comment to explain why legacy NO_* flag passthrough is intentionally not used.
- `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record — new "Deploy-time finding — TLS `options = NO_*` cleanup" bullet (with the stunnel.conf:93 error stanza + Option A/B analysis + cumulative-lesson note covering all three fixup PRs).

### 2026-06-05 (fri, evening) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8a image fixup — replace `dweomer/stunnel` with minimal Alpine-built stunnel; `pid =` empty to coexist with read_only rootfs

Second small fixup PR on top of PR #286 (port fixup squash on master). After the port fixup landed, retried `compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` succeeded at the bind step but the container immediately exited 1 with logs:

```
one or more STUNNEL_SERVICE* values missing:
  STUNNEL_SERVICE=
  STUNNEL_ACCEPT=
  STUNNEL_CONNECT=
```

`docker ps -a` confirmed `Exited (1)` on image digest `c46e11e6cc13` (dweomer/stunnel).

**Root cause.** The `dweomer/stunnel` image has a custom entrypoint script that generates `/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf` from `STUNNEL_SERVICE` / `STUNNEL_ACCEPT` / `STUNNEL_CONNECT` env vars at startup, ignoring (or overwriting) any bind-mounted `/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf`. The PR-8a (#285) image choice was made for "minimum LOC" without verifying that the image's entrypoint accepts a bind-mounted config — the image-internals trap that the diagnostic-design-lesson memory was meant to prevent.

**Fix.** Build stunnel from minimal Alpine ourselves. New file `deploy/stunnel-armA2/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20@sha256:d9e853e87e55526f6b2917df91a2115c36dd7c696a35be12163d44e6e2a4b6bc
RUN apk add --no-cache stunnel && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
ENTRYPOINT ["stunnel", "/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf"]
```

Alpine base pinned by digest for reproducibility. apk pulls stunnel from Alpine's 3.20 package index at build time — stunnel + OpenSSL versions are 3.20-branch-locked. Refresh procedure (when an Alpine / stunnel / OpenSSL security update lands) documented in `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record "Alpine-pin refresh handling note" (replaces the previous "Image-refresh handling note").

**Compose change.** `deploy/docker-compose.armA2.yml`: `image: dweomer/stunnel@sha256:c46e11...` → `build: ./stunnel-armA2` + `image: phantom-stunnel-arm-a2:latest` (compose tags the locally-built image so subsequent `up -d` calls hit the cache). First `compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` after this PR lands triggers a one-time ~10-20 s build.

**Vladislav-requested defensive add: `pid =` empty in `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf`.** The container rootfs is `read_only` per the §4 Arm A.2 Security mini-lock. stunnel's default `/var/run/stunnel.pid` write attempt at startup would fail with EROFS, producing a deploy-time surprise. With `foreground = yes` we don't need a pid file for process management — explicit empty `pid =` removes the write entirely. Catches one more "second deploy-time surprise" class of risk cheaply.

**Removed.** The previous PR-8a (#285) digest pin on `dweomer/stunnel@sha256:c46e11...` no longer applies — that image is not used. The PR-8a fixup (#286) port-mapping `8444:8443` is unchanged. xray REALITY production on `:8443` remains untouched.

**Files updated (this PR, fixup only):**

### 2026-06-05 (fri) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8a port fixup — host port forced to `:8444` because `:8443` held by production `phantom-xray` (Stage 5E REALITY+WSS)

Small fixup PR on top of PR #285 (master `b4fc4cd4`). Discovered at deploy time during Path A operator runbook execution: Step 3 (`docker compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` via overlay) failed with `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8443 failed: port is already allocated`. Diagnostic on VPS confirmed:

```
$ sudo ss -tlnp | grep ':8443'
LISTEN 0 4096 0.0.0.0:8443 0.0.0.0:* users:(("docker-proxy",pid=910161,fd=8))
LISTEN 0 4096    [::]:8443    [::]:* users:(("docker-proxy",pid=910167,fd=8))
$ docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}' | grep 8443
phantom-xray   0.0.0.0:8443->8443/tcp, [::]:8443->8443/tcp
```

Port `:8443` is bound by the production `phantom-xray` container (Stage 5E REALITY+WSS endpoint, deployed 2026-05-07; load-bearing transport for RU users via TSPU 16-KB curtain bypass). The PR #284 Arm A.2 scope mini-lock declared `:8443` as the endpoint shape **without VPS-state verification** — port choice was undertested at scope-lock time. This is a diagnostic-design-lesson recurrence: future scope-lock PRs that declare a host port should grep-verify or SSH-verify the port is free on the target VPS before merge.

**Fix.** Bypass host port changed from `:8443` to `:8444` (SSH-verified free on VPS 2026-06-05). INSIDE the stunnel container the listener stays on `:8443` (no change to `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` `accept = 0.0.0.0:8443`); only the Docker port-mapping in `deploy/docker-compose.armA2.yml` changes from `8443:8443` to `8444:8443` (host:container). xray's `:8443` binding is completely untouched — Arm A.2 stunnel and xray REALITY coexist on different host ports.

**Files changed (this PR, fixup only):**

- `deploy/docker-compose.armA2.yml` — `ports: "8443:8443"` → `ports: "8444:8443"` + header comments + ports-line comment updated with forensic note about xray collision + `depends_on` comment updated to clarify container vs host port semantics.
- `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` — header comment updated (host port `:8444` + xray reason); inside-container `accept = 0.0.0.0:8443` unchanged.
- `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2 — Endpoint shape rule URL `wss://relay.phntm.pro:8443/ws` → `:8444/ws` + inline note about xray collision; Setup steps 1 + 3 updated; Discriminator W/X/Y wording updated; Mini-lock hard gates updated; §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record subsection: new "Deploy-time finding" bullet with full SSH evidence + diagnostic-design-lesson note + Files shipped overlay description updated with port-forced rationale; §5 decision tree A.2 X/Y rows updated; §7 implementation order row 5d updated.
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` — this entry.
- `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` — Last-updated bump + Shipped list extension through PR #285 plus this PR.

**What this PR does NOT change:**

- W/X/Y discriminator semantics — the discriminator reads the same regardless of host port; only the URL the device + curl probe target changes from `:8443/ws` to `:8444/ws`.
- stunnel internal listener (still `accept = 0.0.0.0:8443` inside container).
- stunnel image digest pin (still `dweomer/stunnel@sha256:c46e11...`).
- Caddy cert volume mount, security posture (cap_drop ALL, no-new-privileges, read_only rootfs, tmpfs `/tmp:4m`), TLS hardening, `clients = 50` cap.
- `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO` flag handling.
- xray REALITY production binding on `:8443` — completely untouched.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out (PR-8a port fixup).** Server-side only, zero Android transport code touched. Rule 8 carve-out applies per server-side-only clause.

**WORKING_RULES rule 9.** Deploy-time finding documented with verbatim VPS diagnostic SSH output (ss -tlnp + docker ps + ss verify port :8444 free). No code-state claims beyond what's grep-verified or SSH-verified.

**Track sequencing locked:**

- PR-8a port fixup (this PR): host port `:8444`.
- After merge: operator re-runs §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a runbook Step 3 + Step 4 with the new overlay (`git pull` + `compose up -d stunnel-arm-a2` should now succeed; `curl` against `wss://relay.phntm.pro:8444/ws` for reachability verify).
- After reachability PASS: PR-8b Android `RcDirectArmA2.kt` with `wss://relay.phntm.pro:8444/ws` endpoint URL.

### 2026-06-04 (thu, night) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 PR-8a — stunnel server-side overlay + config + operator runbook; pre-code Gates 1 + 2 both PASS, stunnel stays primary, HAProxy fallback not triggered

Server-side implementation PR for Arm A.2. Two new files in `deploy/` + implementation-record subsection appended to `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` §4 Arm A.2. Zero application or relay code change.

**Pre-code Gate 1 — relay proxy header dependency: PASS.** `grep -rIn 'X-Forwarded-For\|X-Real-IP\|Forwarded' services/relay/src/` on master `f7af95d8` → zero matches. Relay does not depend on proxy headers for auth (signed-challenge per ADR-027 is in-payload), rate-limit, or any other policy. stunnel raw TCP forward to `relay:8080` is safe — relay receives the unmodified TCP stream from the client device after stunnel decrypts. HAProxy fallback per §4 Arm A.2 Refined scope rule (b) NOT triggered.

**Pre-code Gate 2 — Caddy cert format and path: PASS.** SSH-verified on VPS 2026-06-04:

- Cert at `/data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/relay.phntm.pro/relay.phntm.pro.crt`, format PEM (`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`)
- Key at `/data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/relay.phntm.pro/relay.phntm.pro.key`, format PEM EC (`-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- Standalone PEM files, NOT internal database format — read-only volume sharing structurally possible. HAProxy fallback per §4 Arm A.2 Refined scope rule (a) NOT triggered.

**Pre-code bonus — compose network: confirmed.** SSH-verified on VPS 2026-06-04: actual Docker network name `deploy_phantom-internal` (default compose project name `deploy` prefix). `phantom-relay` at `172.18.0.2`, `phantom-caddy` at `172.18.0.6`. stunnel attaches via overlay's `networks: [phantom-internal]` reference — compose merges across `-f` files and resolves the reference to the same actual network. Docker DNS resolves `relay` → relay container IP from inside the stunnel container, so the `connect = relay:8080` directive works.

**stunnel stays primary candidate per §4 Arm A.2 trade-off review.** All three HAProxy fallback escalation triggers from §4 Arm A.2 Refined scope rule are NOT activated. No mini-lock amendment needed.

**Files shipped (this PR, docs + 2 new server-side config files):**

- `deploy/docker-compose.armA2.yml` (NEW) — overlay file. Service `stunnel-arm-a2`, container `phantom-stunnel-arm-a2`, image **pinned by digest, not `:latest`**, at `dweomer/stunnel@sha256:c46e11e6cc135275566de318d739f815c272c23084fc1e65704f7e228992e9ef` (resolved from Docker Hub registry API 2026-06-05), `restart: "no"` (time-boxed), ports `8443:8443`, volumes `caddy-data:/data:ro` + `./stunnel.armA2.conf:/etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf:ro`, network `phantom-internal`, depends_on `relay`. Security posture: `cap_drop ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, `read_only` rootfs, tmpfs `/tmp:4m`.
- `deploy/stunnel.armA2.conf` (NEW) — stunnel config. `[relay-arm-a2]` service block, `accept 0.0.0.0:8443`, `connect relay:8080`, cert + key paths under `/data/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/relay.phntm.pro/` (matching Caddy's own path inside the shared volume), TLS 1.2 minimum + 1.3 preferred, strong cipher suites only, `clients = 50` connection cap.
- `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md` (UPDATED) — §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record subsection appended with Gate evidence + file inventory + operator runbook (open / verify / capture / revert) + cert-rotation handling note + WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out + rule 9 grep-verified-per-claim list.
- `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` (UPDATED) — this session entry.
- `docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` (UPDATED) — Last-updated bump + Shipped list extension through PR #284 plus this PR.

**Operator runbook (Vladislav-owned, per §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record).** Eight steps: enable `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1`, recreate relay, bring up stunnel-arm-a2 via overlay, reachability verify with curl WS upgrade probe, capture window run with PR-8b APK, tear down stunnel-arm-a2 via `compose rm -fs`, revert heartbeat-echo flag, confirm relay healthy on production path. Full bash sequence in track doc.

**WORKING_RULES rule 8 carve-out (PR-8a).** Server-side overlay + config only. Zero Android transport code touched. No `RcDirectArmA2.kt` here (that lands in PR-8b). Rule 8 transport regression gate carve-out applies per the rule's server-side-only clause.

**WORKING_RULES rule 9 (no merge without verification).** Every claim in this PR is grep-verified or SSH-VPS-verified — full list in §4 Arm A.2 PR-8a implementation record subsection.

**Track sequencing locked:**

- PR-8a (this PR): server-side overlay + config + operator runbook.
- PR-8b (next, Android): `RcDirectArmA2.kt` near-clone of `RcDirectArmD` with `:8443` endpoint URL + new `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM_A2_URL` BuildConfig field. AppContainer + Service wire-up under precedence A → A.2 → B → C → D → production.
- Field test: Tecno Tele2 LTE 15-min capture through `wss://relay.phntm.pro:8443/ws` after PR-8b APK builds and operator runs the open/verify steps of the §4 Arm A.2 runbook.
- Arm A.2 outcome record will append to §4 Arm A.2 subsection (analogous to Arm C and Arm D outcome subsections) after the field run completes.

### 2026-06-04 (thu, evening) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm A.2 scope mini-lock — stunnel primary candidate locked after structured trade-off review; W/X/Y three-outcome discriminator + public TLS surface security mini-lock; Arm E sequenced after Arm A.2 outcome

Single docs-only PR promoting Arm A.2 from §9 parking lot to §4 active arm per the Arm D outcome deviation (PR #283 squash `601d9d8d`).

**Scope-locking process.** Structured trade-off review of four TLS terminator candidates (stunnel / HAProxy / Nginx / Rust-in-relay) across four lenses (diagnostic sharpness, security, operational risk, process/architect). Pre-lean: stunnel. P1 objection check found no P1 objections across all four lenses; P2 hard gates (cert sourcing, relay proxy header dependency check, time-box, no-production-promotion, security minimum) baked into the mini-lock as verification steps for the implementation PR. Nginx ruled out as redundant with HAProxy in the same category. Rust-in-relay ruled out as production code touch for a diagnostic — inconsistent with the Arm A/B/C/D minimum-change pattern.

**Why before Arm E.** Arm E (WS rotation) extends session lifetime by proactive reconnect — presupposes the next WS session would be healthy. The Arm D asymmetry makes that presupposition unsafe: rotating to a fresh WS faces the same uplink-Text-fails-immediately failure mode on the new connection. Arm A.2 discriminates the layer at which the asymmetry emerges (Caddy edge vs below-Caddy) before deciding whether Arm E remains a viable next step.

**Primary candidate: stunnel.** Pure TLS unwrap → raw TCP forward to the relay container on the Docker compose network (`connect = relay:8080`); `127.0.0.1:8080` is valid only for a host-network / native stunnel deployment and must be explicitly documented in PR-8a if taken. No HTTP awareness, no WS-aware proxying, no Upgrade-header parsing — relay receives HTTP/WS upgrade directly after stunnel decrypts. Minimises variables by removing Caddy's TLS + HTTP/WS proxy layer while adding only a TLS unwrap + raw TCP forwarder, smallest new public attack surface (single-purpose terminator with low historical CVE volume), simplest config and revert.

**Fallback: HAProxy.** Activated only if stunnel reveals a hard blocker during design or implementation (cert sharing impossible, relay genuine proxy header dependency, or stunnel cannot provide required TLS mode). Fallback escalation is mechanical — does not require re-running the trade-off review.

**W/X/Y three-outcome discriminator with locked wording bounds.** None of W/X/Y attribute the kill to a specific lower layer with confidence higher than the evidence supports:

- **W (stunnel sustains WS ≥ 3× Tele2 baseline + Text echoes succeed):** Caddy edge path is in the kill chain or contributes. Does NOT prove "TLS innocent" — TLS is still present in stunnel; only the specific Caddy TLS + HTTP + WS-proxy layer is removed. Trigger: open `RC-CADDY-FIX1` track.
- **X (Ping survives, Text dies — Arm D asymmetry persists):** Asymmetry origin below Caddy edge OR in a layer Caddy and stunnel share. Caddy loses priority as proximal cause. Trigger: below-edge / carrier-side investigation track; 3.2b.1 escalates from "parked" to "needed". Does NOT single-attribute kill.
- **Y (Mode 2 signature persists through `:8443`):** Caddy strongly loses priority. Structural carrier / path / lower-layer kill. Direct WS realtime on Tele2 LTE is structurally hard. Trigger: uplift realtime per ADR-028 4-layer architecture; open Arm F parking-lot mini-lock; Arm E deprecated. Does NOT prove "TLS broken" or "WebSocket broken".

**P2 hard gates baked in (verified in implementation PR before deploy):**

1. **Cert sourcing strategy** — stunnel reads Caddy cert + key from Caddy's volume read-only; cert/key bytes do NOT enter git; exact path determined on VPS during implementation.
2. **Relay proxy header dependency check** — `grep -rIn 'X-Forwarded-For\|X-Real-IP\|Forwarded' services/relay/src/` BEFORE deploy; if matches found, evaluate impact and consider HAProxy fallback.
3. **Time-box hard limit** — stunnel container up only during capture window; separate `deploy/docker-compose.armA2.yml` overlay file NOT merged into persistent deploy.
4. **No production traffic promotion** — debug-flag-gated client only; production `BuildConfig.RELAY_URL` and `RelayTransportFactory.kt:71` unchanged; no `:8443` URL in production code paths.
5. **Security mini-lock** — public TLS 1.2+ only, no cleartext, auth (signed-challenge per ADR-027) unchanged, connection cap + rate-limit at stunnel or relay level, explicit deploy/verify/revert runbook, AGPL compliance preserved (stunnel is GPL-2.0).

### 2026-06-04 (thu, late) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm D field run CLOSED → H-D refuted (application-data Text heartbeat does not survive Mode 2); control/application delivery asymmetry at relay application layer re-prioritises Arm A.2 ahead of Arm E

Single docs-only PR closing Arm D after the field run and refining the §5 next-step rule based on the empirical asymmetry observation.

**Arm D field run (Tecno Tele2 LTE 2026-06-04 13:14:10 — 13:30:20 UTC, PR-7 APK `phantom-armd.apk` SHA `bbcf64278c13bc28437a0aa5196fe7b30007348203e8a41a7612cc23aac690c8`, `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1` on VPS `.env`):**

- **Client log:** 21 `RC_DIRECT_ARM_D_ws_open`, 19 `RC_DIRECT_ARM_D_ws_failure`, 39 `RC_DIRECT_ARM_D_echo_sent`, **0** `RC_DIRECT_ARM_D_echo_received`, 0 heartbeat-sender exceptions. Across every `ws_failure` summary: `echo_received=0 echo_missing=N last_echo_rtt_ms=-1 inbound_text_frames=0 inbound_binary_frames=0`.
- **Relay log:** 21 `event="connect"` (conn_id 0..20 matching client `ws_open`), 20 `ws_protocol_ping_received` (conn_id 0..19; conn_id 20 too short before capture end), 20 `ws_protocol_pong_sent` (matching). **0** `event=heartbeat_echo_received` (per-frame log at `services/relay/src/routes.rs:523`). **0** `event=heartbeat_echo_sent`. **0** `event=heartbeat_echo_rejected`.
- **Mode 2 carrier signature persists** across all sessions (s=1: 30 002 ms lifetime, "after 0 successful ping/pongs", ≈ 2× ping_interval; s=2..s=20: ~45 008 ms lifetime, "after 1 successful ping/pongs", ≈ 3× ping_interval). F-Mode2-cadence-invariant fact (§1) widens: the signature is also data-frame-heartbeat-invariant.
- **First-session downlink Pong loss isolated to s=1.** Relay conn_id=0 shows ping_received + pong_sent at +15 s, but the device reports "after 0 successful ping/pongs" — Pong was sent but never observed on the device. From s=2 onward, "after 1 successful ping/pongs" — first downlink Pong arrives. Read with the asymmetry below, the path tolerates exactly one control round-trip per session before subsequent uplink frames stop reaching the relay application layer.

**H-D refuted.** Application-data Text heartbeat does not survive Mode 2. A production short-message heartbeat would replicate the failure mode it was intended to mitigate. No production-promotion candidate from Arm D. Operator runbook revert step fires after this PR merges: `RELAY_ENABLE_HEARTBEAT_ECHO=1` removed from VPS `.env`, `docker compose up -d --force-recreate relay`.

**Control/application delivery asymmetry at relay application layer** — primary new discriminator. For sessions s=2..s=20, the device sends WS Control Ping **and** WS Text echo seq=1 at approximately the same wall-clock instant (~+15 s after `ws_open`). Relay logs `ws_protocol_ping_received` per session but **never** logs `heartbeat_echo_received`. The two frame classes diverge in delivery to the relay application layer despite traversing the same WS connection in the same direction at the same time. Exact cause of the divergence remains open across at least four hypotheses: OkHttp writer-side enqueue-vs-egress timing on the device, Caddy/TLS WS frame handling distinguishing opcode classes, carrier path stateful inspection, or interaction across these layers. `ws.send(Text)` returning success only proves the frame was queued in OkHttp on the device — not that the bytes physically left the radio.

**Side-finding (not blocker):** relay `event=session_summary` and `event=disconnect` lines absent for all 21 sessions in the captured docker-log window. Two candidate explanations: (a) the docker-logs capture filter dropped them (the SSH `grep -E` invocation had bash quoting issues, so the command that actually produced the captured log is not reproducible from chat); (b) the relay WS handler does not observe client-side teardown — `.next().await` is still pending across all 21 conn_ids when capture ended, indicating a possible server-side WS-handler leak when the carrier silently half-closes TCP. (a) is parsimonious; (b) would be a separate concrete relay bug if reproducible. Does **not** affect the Arm D verdict — per-frame `event=heartbeat_echo_received` fires on every accepted Text receipt at `services/relay/src/routes.rs:523`, independent of session close, and that counter shows zero events. Tracked as a separate low-priority diagnostic outside this track.

**PR #280 lifecycle fix held in field.** Zero heartbeat-sender exceptions across all 21 sessions, no `CancellationException` noise, `openedAt: CompletableDeferred<Long>` gating between `onOpen` and the heartbeat coroutine shipped cleanly. The first echo seq=1 was visible per logcat in every session that lived past +15 s. Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame held on the client side: all 39 outbound heartbeat frames used the `RcDirectArmD.kt` WS Text path, never WS Ping/Pong. Relay-side `build_heartbeat_echo_response` was not exercised in this run because relay observed 0 `heartbeat_echo_received`; therefore no relay `Message::Text` echo response, and no relay `Message::Pong`, was constructed.

### 2026-06-04 (thu) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 Arm C field matrix CLOSED → H-C refuted (cadence is detection timing, not fix lever); Arm D scope refined with architect pre-review design locks for PR-6 relay echo handler

Single docs-only PR covering the empirical closure of Arm C and the design refinement of Arm D before the relay PR ships.

**Arm A timeline recap (PR #275 + PR #276 + emulator smoke + Tecno tunnel field test 2026-06-03):** loopback bypass via `adb reverse` + SSH local-forward proved relay binary + raw OkHttp + relay WS layer can sustain a WS for 15+ minutes when the data path is loopback (Tecno → USB → Windows → SSH tunnel → VPS loopback → relay). v11 Arm A Tele2 baseline (29 sessions × ~31 s) did NOT reproduce through the tunnel. But the tunnel bypassed Tele2 LTE radio so H-A vs H-B remained architecturally undecidable — recorded as PARTIAL/PASS for loopback-path stability only. Lesson learned saved in memory `feedback_diagnostic_design_must_isolate_one_variable.md`. Arm A.2 (public non-Caddy TLS bypass) added to §9 parking lot as conditional fallback if Arms C/D/E all FAIL.

**Arm C field matrix (Tecno Tele2 LTE 2026-06-03 evening, four sequential 15-min captures via PR #277 master `bbc575a8` APKs):**

| Run | Ping interval | Failures | Median lifetime | Pattern |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Arm B baseline (raw OkHttp at 15 s) | 15 s | 18 | 45 s | first session 0 pong, then 1 pong |
| Arm C 10 s | 10 s | 23 | 30 s | first session 0 pong, then 1 pong |
| Arm C 20 s | 20 s | 15 | 60 s | first session 0 pong, then 1 pong |
| Arm C 30 s | 30 s | 9 | 90 s | first session 0 pong, then 1 pong |

**H-C as a production fix lever is refuted.** Cadence sensitivity is observed, but only as detection timing: changing `pingInterval` changes WHEN OkHttp notices the already-broken path, not WHETHER the path breaks. Linear scaling decomposes as: for subsequent sessions, one successful ping/pong was counted, then the next Pong was missed, then OkHttp failed on the following scheduled ping because `awaitingPong` was still true → lifetime ≈ 3 × ping_interval. For the first session, zero successful pongs → first Pong missed → failure on next ping tick → lifetime ≈ 2 × ping_interval. Mode 2 "first 0, then 1" carrier signature persists across all cadence values. Production `RelayTransportFactory.kt:71 pingInterval(15_000L, MILLISECONDS)` stays at 15 s. Matrix validity clean — production Ktor path silent across all 4 runs (`session_summary = 0`, `ws_ping_timeout_diag = 0`); Arm B baseline only fired `RC_DIRECT_ARM_B_*`; Arm C 10/20/30 only fired `RC_DIRECT_ARM_C_*`. Saved to memory `project_arm_c_lifetime_linear_in_interval_2026_06_04.md` for future-track reference.

Per-frame logs at `debug!` level; session-level `echo_frames_received` / `echo_frames_sent` added to existing `session_summary` info line. Operator runbook for `.env` flip + `docker compose up -d --force-recreate relay` + revert step.
- **§1 F-Mode2-cadence-invariant** fact added — "kill is independent of WS-control-frame cadence" carried forward as a primary fact for any future track scoping (Arms E/F, future stability tracks, 3.2b.1 thresholds).

**Architect pre-review for PR-6 (run in parallel during this PR's draft).** Eight concerns reviewed: code site (insert between is_ping fast-path and handle_message fall-through), feature flag handling (read once at startup in `RelayConfig::from_env()`, store on `Arc<AppState>`), payload validation (length cap + exact prefix + u64 parse), logging (debug-level per-frame + info-level session counters), operator runbook, fail-closed parse rule, test plan (unit test for prefix/length validation + integration test for round-trip), Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame (P0 — inline comment + unit test asserting returned opcode type). PR-6 will absorb the architect findings directly into the commit body; mini-lock captures only the protocol-level locks (payload format, default-off flag, length cap, fail-closed parse).

**Track sequencing locked:**
- PR-5 (this PR, docs): Arm C outcome + Arm D scope refine.
- PR-6 (next, relay code): `services/relay/src/config.rs` adds `heartbeat_echo_enabled: bool` to `RelayConfig`; `services/relay/src/routes.rs` adds echo handler in the `Message::Text` dispatch between the JSON `{"type":"ping"}` fast-path and `handle_message` fall-through; `services/relay/src/main.rs` startup log line announces the flag state; unit + integration tests. ~80 LOC relay code total, default-off, zero behaviour change in production traffic until VPS operator flips the flag.
- PR-7 (after PR-6 lands + VPS deploys with flag on): NEW `apps/android/src/androidMain/.../diagnostic/RcDirectArmD.kt` near-clone of `RcDirectArmC`. Sends one heartbeat every 15 s with the canonical payload; counts `RC_DIRECT_ARM_D_echo_received seq=N rtt_ms=...` round-trips. Read-only outbound carve-out from Inv-RawArmReadOnly explicitly noted inline. AppContainer + Service wire-up under precedence Arm A → B → C → D → production.
- Field test: Tecno Tele2 LTE 15-min capture through production network. Verdict per §6 + the H-D discrimination question: if first inbound heartbeat after WS upgrade arrives reliably (echo counts ≥ 1 within first 15 s) while OkHttp Ping/Pong dies → kill is WS-control-frame-specific. If first echo also lost at the Mode 2 anchor → kill is at packet layer, broader than control frames. Either outcome shapes Arm E + Arm A.2 + RC-CADDY-FIX1 decisions.

CHIP1 stays parked at `78bd979e`. 3.2b.1 stays unfrozen but parked behind RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 outcome per Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence.

### 2026-06-03 (wed, late) · RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 OPENED — strategic pivot after Phase 2; primary fix track for Direct WS stability; 3.2b.1 stays unfrozen but parked; ADR-028 locks 4-layer architecture intent

Single track-opening journal entry covering two sequential PRs as the locked sequence's PR-1 + PR-2 (PR-3+ are per-arm code/relay PRs that follow this mini-lock):

**Strategic pivot context (locked after Phase 2 evidence landed in PR #272).** After RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 Phase 2 closed with "Direct WS unreliable on both Wi-Fi and Tele2 LTE, root cause below app/Ktor (unstable TCP/TLS path)", the natural next move was to design 3.2b.1 (adaptive validation = switch chain when Direct WS bad). I rejected that ordering: 3.2b.1 is a UX safety net, not a fix. Primary work = stabilize Direct WS at its source. RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 is the fix track; 3.2b.1 stays parked behind it per `Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence`.

**PR #273 squash `6c923c39`** — PR-1 of three locked PRs. CI loopback-only-ports gate at `.github/workflows/deploy-lint.yml`. Python + PyYAML structural parse of `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, fail-closed on relay service port bindings that don't start with `127.0.0.1:` or `::1:` (or `[::1]:`). Catches the dangerous typo `ports: ["8081:8080"]` which Docker silently defaults to `0.0.0.0:8081` (publicly exposes a TLS-free WS endpoint, bypassing Caddy edge protections). Workflow short-circuits on irrelevant PRs (same pattern as `relay.yml`). Long-form dict-syntax `host_ip` handled symmetrically — missing `host_ip` treated as `0.0.0.0`. P3 nit comment fixup landed in same PR (PyYAML is workflow-installed, not preinstalled). Ships **before** any Arm A experiment so `Inv-BypassIsLoopbackOnly` is enforced before the diagnostic can introduce the risk.

**This PR (docs) — PR-2 of three locked PRs.** Two new files + two existing files updated, +445 / -6 lines, zero code touch.

- **NEW `docs/tracks/rc-direct-stability1.md`** — track-opening mini-lock §1-§12 in the Phase 1 / Phase 2 pattern. §1 carries forward Phase 1+2 proven facts (F-Mode1 / F-Mode2-pp0 / F-Mode2-pp1 / F-NotKtor / F-NotCount / F-CaddyAtMax / F-RelayInternal / F-AuthIntegrity / F-CIGuard). §2 maps the 6 fix candidates to hypothesis space H-A through H-F. §3 locks 9 invariants (`Inv-NoProductionRegression`, `Inv-NoCallsVoiceTouch`, `Inv-OnlyDiagnosticCadenceChange` with precision on `RelayTransportFactory.kt:71`, `Inv-NoSpinningUntilEvidence`, `Inv-BypassIsLoopbackOnly` enforced by PR #273 CI gate, `Inv-NoLanInNsc` cleartext whitelist read-only, `Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame` PR-H1e regression protection, `Inv-RotationNotForCallSignaling` ADR-025 signaling continuity, `Inv-RelayChangeNeedsItsOwnPR` for Arms D + F). §4 scopes 6 experimental arms: Arm A Caddy bypass (loopback-only, plain ws://, ~5 min reversible) is primary discriminator H-A vs H-B; Arm B Caddy tuning verification auto-closes when Arm A reads H-B per F-CaddyAtMax (Caddyfile already at WS-friendliest extreme); Arm C OkHttp ping interval matrix via new `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_PING_INTERVAL_MS` debug-only field on raw-OkHttp diagnostic path; Arm D data-frame heartbeat through WS Text/Binary (NOT Ping) requires relay-side echo-opcode PR before Android APK; Arm E short-lived WS rotation via generation-scoped timer with `state != CALL_ACTIVE` gate; Arm F SSE/long-poll alternative deferred to its own future relay-track mini-lock per architect "relay-track-scale" cost assessment. §5 maps each Arm outcome to one of 11 decision-tree rows including mixed-verdict cases. §6 locks ship criterion with three-way verdict: **PASS = zero `SocketTimeoutException: sent ping but didn't receive pong` events in 15-min capture on target network**, **PARTIAL = p95 lifetime ≥ 3× baseline AND no delivery regression but ping-timeouts persist**, **FAIL = neither**. The PASS / PARTIAL asymmetry was added per Vladislav review: "стало лучше, значит ship" is the lazy-fail case — a WS that holds 2 minutes instead of 30 seconds is observably better but still structurally dying. §7 locks cheap-first implementation order A → B (auto-close after A) → C → D-pre (relay PR) → D-android → E → F (deferred). §8 hard out-of-scope: no production transport edits, no 3.2b.1 work, no calls/voice touch, no CHIP1, no app-level WS Ping, no NSC widening, no release-build `DEBUG_BYPASS_URL`. §9 parking lot enumerates Arm F mini-lock / RC-CADDY-FIX1 track / 3.2b.1 Council / server-side BPF / second Android handset / architecture-intent operationalisation. §10 process gates carry forward WORKING_RULES 8 + 9, durable log pattern, first-person voice. §11 locks 9 open questions Vladislav-direction during the architect + security review cycle. §12 source-of-truth pointers cross-reference RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 + ADR-028 + ADR-003 / 020 / 025 / 027 / 010 / 011 + PR #273 CI workflow + relay routes.rs auth validator + RcDirectArmB template.

- **NEW `docs/adr/ADR-028-direct-stability-architecture-intent.md`** — Direct Stability Architecture Intent. Locks 4-layer reliability architecture as durable contract for future stability / transport / privacy decisions. **Layer 1** Messages: REST store-and-forward, always available (REST is source of truth, Direct WS is optimisation on top). **Layer 2** Realtime signaling: Direct WS / SSE / alternative path with graceful fallback (3.2b.1 when shipped is the policy layer selecting which carrier is active). **Layer 3** Voice notes: REST media transport, not WS (D2b pivot 2026-05-17 already established this; M2 trilogy shipped it; ADR-028 locks the principle). **Layer 4** Calls: WebRTC + TURN, not app-level WebSocket (signaling via ADR-025 sealed-sender; media plane never WS-tunneled). Tor + Reality are privacy/resilience overlays, not the media foundation. Includes "Security baseline for plain-WS diagnostic paths" section that documents Arm A's safety property (integrity-based auth via ADR-027 Ed25519 + nonce freshness — not TLS confidentiality; CI-enforced loopback binding via PR #273; release-build APK double-gate; time-boxed experiment window). Related ADRs: 003 (Transport Abstraction) + 010 / 011 (transport / network) + 020 (Adaptive Transport Selection) + 025 (Call Signaling E2EE) + 027 (Per-User Signed Challenge Auth). No supersession — ADR-028 is operational decision within existing framework.

- **`docs/project/MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md`** — Last updated bumped to 2026-06-03 (wed, late) with the strategic pivot summary. Shipped list adds #273 + this PR. Track state declares RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 closed (Phase 1 + Phase 2), RC-DIRECT-STABILITY1 opened as primary fix track, 3.2b.1 parked behind it.

**Architect + security pre-draft review (2026-06-03).** Architect subagent independent review surfaced 5 P1/P2/P3 findings absorbed into the mini-lock: Arm B reframed from "tuning matrix" to "verification" per F-CaddyAtMax (Caddyfile already at WS-friendliest); Arm A technical contract clarified (loopback-only, plain ws://, ~5 min reversible compose delta + container restart); Arm C constrained to raw-OkHttp diagnostic path with new `DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_PING_INTERVAL_MS` field per `Inv-OnlyDiagnosticCadenceChange`; Arm D requires relay-side echo PR before Android APK + `Inv-DataFrameNotControlFrame` against PR-H1e regression; Arm E rotation gap concern addressed by `Inv-RotationNotForCallSignaling`; Arm F flagged as relay-track-scale work, deferred. Security-reviewer subagent independent review surfaced 2 P1 blockers: SB-1 CI lint gate for `Inv-BypassIsLoopbackOnly` (shipped in PR #273 — closed); SB-2 `DEBUG_BYPASS_URL` double-gate pattern (release-pinned empty + `BuildConfig.DEBUG && DEBUG_BYPASS_URL.isNotEmpty()` runtime check + `Inv-NoLanInNsc` against cleartext whitelist widening — captured in mini-lock §3). 3 P2 non-blockers documented in ADR-028 (auth integrity-not-confidentiality property; debug APK leak risk minimal; plain-WS post-auth metadata exposure short-window-OK with revert checklist).

**Track sequencing locked:**
- **PR-1 (#273, shipped):** CI lint gate ships first so `Inv-BypassIsLoopbackOnly` is enforced before any Arm A experiment can add a port binding.
- **PR-2 (this PR):** Mini-lock + ADR-028. Track-opening docs.
- **PR-3+ (next):** Arm A compose-file loopback delta + `RcDirectArmA.kt` diagnostic class — both gated by PR #273 CI guard + new `Inv-BypassIsLoopbackOnly` mini-lock invariant + double-gated `DEBUG_BYPASS_URL`. Arm A is the primary discriminator for H-A (Caddy interferes) vs H-B (Caddy innocent). If H-A confirmed, RC-CADDY-FIX1 track opens; if H-B confirmed, continue to Arms C → D → E.

**Track-closing journal entry will appear when §6 verdict (PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL) lands, in the same single-track-closing-entry pattern as Phase 1 / Phase 2 closures.**

### 2026-06-03 (wed) · RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 Phase 2 CLOSED + 3.2b.1 UNFROZEN — mini-lock + marker emit + PCAPdroid v12 capture set + tshark spot-checks; Direct WebSocket unreliable on both Wi-Fi and Tele2, root cause is below app/Ktor and manifests as unreliable TCP/TLS path (not proven to be an OkHttp/Ktor counting bug), 3.2b.1 unfreezes as UX-protection for both modes

Single track-closing journal entry covering three sequential PRs in one day:

**PR #270 squash `ca620fe6`** — Phase 2 mini-lock rev1 (PCAPdroid wire-correlation plan). Docs-only single file `docs/tracks/rc-direct-ws-death1.md` +226 lines. Critical structure choice: two-tier evidence model — **Tier 1 (primary gate, mandatory)** = raw wire correlation via PCAPdroid raw mode (TCP/TLS Application Data records present-or-absent at the UTC moment relay sent a Pong, plus TCP-layer evidence); **Tier 2 (optional, deferred to Phase 2b)** = decrypted WS Pong frame proof via TLS keylog / PCAPdroid-mitm / server-side BPF. Tier 1 is sufficient to discriminate H-A (return-path loss) from H-B/C/D (device-side / OkHttp internal mis-handling) without the additional TLS decryption ceremony. Arms (no new code): Arm P1 Wi-Fi Mode 1 capture (9th Pong target), Arm P2 Tele2 LTE Mode 2 capture (1st-2nd Pong target), Arm P3 PCAPdroid-on control reading vs Phase 1 baselines (enforces `Inv-PcapDoesNotMaskMode`). Mode bins (Vladislav-locked §20, post-hoc, no discard): Mode 1 = `pp_count >= 6` AND `120 s <= lifetime <= 170 s`; Mode 2 = `pp_count <= 2` AND `lifetime <= 60 s`. 3.2b.1 unpause criteria explicit in §24 acceptance gates per mode (decoupled across modes); OQ-P1..OQ-P8 Vladislav-locked 2026-06-03. Six new Phase-2-specific invariants in §21: `Inv-PcapDoesNotMaskMode`, `Inv-NoTrafficBeyondTelemetry`, `Inv-ProductionUnchanged`, `Inv-PcapReadOnlyAnalysis`, `Inv-WallClockAlignment`, `Inv-NoCarrierOrUiClaim`. P3 comment-only fixup landed in same PR (gate wording `== "B"` not `!= "0"` after Vladislav PR review).

**PR #271 squash `358e063e`** — Phase 2 marker emit. Two files +45 lines, zero production code change, zero transport behaviour change, compile-verified locally (`./gradlew :apps:android:compileDebugKotlinAndroid` BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 37 s). One new Gradle property `phase2Mode` mirroring `rcDirectArm` pattern + matching `BuildConfig.DEBUG_PHASE2_MODE` String field with values `"0"` / `"P1"` / `"P2"` / `"P3"`, release-pinned to `"0"`. One `Log.i` line in `RcDirectArmB.runOneSession()` right after `sessionStartMs` is captured before any session I/O, emitting `PHASE2_CAPTURE_MARKER mode=${BuildConfig.DEBUG_PHASE2_MODE} utc=$sessionStartMs s=$sessionEpoch`. Per-session emit (not per-arm-start) because `Inv-WallClockAlignment` cross-correlation needs a per-session UTC anchor that maps to relay-side `ws_protocol_pong_sent` cycles. Under existing `RC_DIRECT_ARM_B` log tag (no new tag added, canonical logcat capture commands unchanged). PR body markdown fixup applied via Bash heredoc (per `feedback_pr_body_edit_no_powershell_replace.md` — PowerShell `-replace` + `Out-File` squashes newlines).

**This PR (docs)** — Phase 2 outcome — evidence summary §31-§39 appended to `docs/tracks/rc-direct-ws-death1.md`. **PCAPdroid v12 capture set: 6 sessions × 3 artifacts = 18 files** archived in `C:\temp\phase2-day-2026-06-03\`. Sessions: Arm P3 Wi-Fi control × 1 (APK `09b3ec5c...`), Arm P1 Wi-Fi capture × 2 (APK `2ca6908c...`), Arm P3 Tele2 LTE control × 1 (APK_P3 reinstall), Arm P2 Tele2 LTE capture × 2 (APK `ce8c52de...`). All APKs built on master `358e063e` with `rcDirectArm=B` and one of three `phase2Mode` values per Phase 2 mini-lock §22. Tecno serial `<redacted-device-serial>`. Initial `arm-p1-wifi-cap1-relay.log` was 0 bytes on first pull; re-pull on same field-test day succeeded at 132 940 bytes, promoting Session 2 from PARTIAL to PASS for Mode 1 evidence. Wall-clock alignment per `Inv-WallClockAlignment` §21 verified within ≤ 1 s at field-test day start.

**Independent tshark verification:** `tshark` 4.6.6 installed via `winget install --id WiresharkFoundation.Wireshark`. Three architect-anchored spot-checks executed against raw pcap artifacts. **Spot-check #1 (Mode 1 P1 Wi-Fi cap2, 9th Pong anchor `06:11:00.196Z`):** `0` inbound TLS records ±2 s, `0` packets of any kind ±10 s from `65.108.154.152:443` — architect parser output confirmed, return-path loss empirically proven by raw wire. **Spot-check #2 (Mode 2 pp=0 P2 Tele2 cap1 first session, 1st Pong anchor `06:51:28.529Z`):** `0` inbound TLS records ±2 s, `0` packets ±10 s — architect confirmed, return-path loss confirmed for Mode 2 pp=0 sub-case. **Spot-check #3 (Mode 2 pp=1 P2 Tele2 cap1, conn_id=197, 2nd-ping anchor near `06:52:13.452Z`):** outbound 28-byte TLS Application Data record observed at `06:52:14.649Z` (1.2 s after architect's expected anchor — within tolerance); relay logs `pings_received=1` only for conn_id=197 + `since_last_ping_ms=153650` + `Connection reset without closing handshake`. **Tshark refinement:** TCP ACK from relay at `06:52:14.650Z` (1 ms after the outbound 2nd ping) — `0`-byte TLS payload, pure TCP ACK. This introduces TCP-layer ambiguity that architect's "похоже на uplink loss" did not address: discriminating "Tecno-side TCP retransmit satisfied by duplicate ACK → IP-layer uplink loss" from "TCP packet arrived at relay's TCP buffer but the inner WS frame was not delivered to relay's WS application layer → relay-side TLS/WS delivery stall" requires TCP seq/ack-number deep-dive or server-side BPF. Both candidates point to the same operational conclusion: link Tecno ↔ relay is unreliable in this sub-case.

**Phase 2 verdict (Vladislav-locked):**
- **Mode 1 (Wi-Fi 8-pong rhythm) — H-A confirmed (return-path loss).** 11 Mode 1 deaths across cap1+cap2, 10 with relay-side `ws_protocol_pong_sent` anchor, 0 inbound TLS records on device pcap. `Inv-PcapDoesNotMaskMode` satisfied (Arm P3 Wi-Fi control 5 deaths × 8 pp × ~150 s matches v9 baseline within tolerance).
- **Mode 2 (Tele2 LTE severe 0-1-pong rhythm) — H-A confirmed for pp=0 sub-case (3 deaths, return-path loss); TCP-layer ambiguous for pp=1 sub-case (36 deaths).** Both sub-cases share the same operational implication: link is unreliable. `Inv-PcapDoesNotMaskMode` satisfied (Arm P3 Tele2 control 23 deaths × 0-1 pp × 30-45 s matches v11 Arm A baseline).
- **H-B/C/D "inbound TLS reached device but OkHttp failed to count Pong" branch is refuted** for every death where Tier 1 evidence is conclusive (all Mode 1 + Mode 2 pp=0 — no inbound TLS records present at the expected anchor). **Mode 2 pp=1 remains TCP-layer ambiguous** per §32(c) — outbound TLS payload present and relay TCP-acks it, but the relay-side TLS/WS delivery stall candidate cannot be excluded without TCP seq-number or BPF analysis. **Does not block 3.2b.1 unfreeze** per §35.
- **3.2b.1 unpause decision per §24 acceptance gates:** **3.2b.1 unfreezes as UX-protection for both modes.** `Inv-NoChangeUntilEvidence` (Phase 1 mini-lock §3) is satisfied. Combined verdict: Mode 1 closed as return-path loss; Mode 2 closed as unstable TCP/TLS path with mixed sub-cases.

**Architect interpretation reconciliation (§37):** spot-checks #1 and #2 confirm architect parser output. Spot-check #3 refines architect's "похоже на uplink loss" hypothesis — operational verdict ("link unreliable") stands, but the specific mechanism is left open per §32(c) and parked in §38. The refinement does NOT change the §35 unfreeze verdict.

**Track state:**
- Phase 2 closed. RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 track shipped its purpose (discriminate client-stack vs network-stack root cause; produce evidence to unblock 3.2b.1).
- 3.2b.1 commonMain code path **unfreezes** for design + implementation work, which proceeds on the WS-HEALTH-STATE1 track in a separate session after Council on revised scope.
- **Mode 2 pp=1 TCP-layer mechanism discrimination** ("uplink loss" vs "relay-side TLS/WS delivery stall") parked per §38 — not load-bearing for 3.2b.1 unfreeze decision; open only if 3.2b.1 implementation surfaces operational questions needing this discrimination.
- **Phase 2b — TLS keylog / decrypted Pong proof** not triggered (Tier 1 closed both modes' discrimination gates); re-evaluate only if a future track needs WS-frame-level evidence beyond TCP/TLS record-level.
- **Server-side BPF on Hetzner relay host** not triggered (same status as Phase 2b).
- **Second Android handset on Wi-Fi + Tele2** not triggered (Phase 2 closed both modes on Tecno alone).
- **Council session on revised 3.2b.1 scope** (Mode 2 severity, mixed sub-cases, bidirectional fragility, threshold implications for adaptive validation) follows this PR per Vladislav direction. Council outcome lands as a new design-note PR on the WS-HEALTH-STATE1 track, not as a new Phase 3 section here.
- `CHIP1` parked at `78bd979e`.

**Operational findings recorded for repeatability:**
- PCAPdroid in raw mode preserves the actual relay peer IP (`65.108.154.152` for Hetzner relay) — not NAT'd to PCAPdroid's local VPN gateway (`10.215.173.1`). VPN tunnels source-side traffic; remote peer is unchanged.
- PowerShell `Tee-Object` produces UTF-16 LE BOM logcat files; standard `grep` doesn't handle them well. PowerShell-side conversion via `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText` + `WriteAllText(..., UTF8Encoding(false))` produces a UTF-8 variant for `grep`/`tshark` consumption. Applied to relay logs (which also have ANSI escape codes from `docker logs --color` default — strip via `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z]//g'`).
- For Wireshark 4.6+ on TLSv1.3 traffic, the filter `tls.record.content_type == 23` may not match because TLSv1.3 wraps content type in `tls.record.opaque_type`. The simpler filter `tls` (matches the dissector) works reliably across Wireshark versions and captures all TLS records including Application Data.
- Per-session `[DateTime]::UtcNow.ToString("o")` recording in an operator notebook is the load-bearing artifact for the three-way wall-clock cross-correlation (Tecno logcat / relay docker logs / PCAPdroid pcap timestamps). The on-device `PHASE2_CAPTURE_MARKER mode=... utc=... s=...` logcat anchor (PR #271) is the in-band variant of the same data; both are kept.

### 2026-06-02 (tue, late) · RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 Phase 1 CLOSED — mini-lock + Arm B code + v11 evidence summary; Ktor adapter ruled out, two failure modes identified, Phase 2 PCAPdroid sequenced next

Single track-closing journal entry covering three sequential PRs in one day:

**PR #265 squash `99cb1d6f`** — RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 mini-lock rev4. Docs-only single file `docs/tracks/rc-direct-ws-death1.md` +349 lines. Six-arm experimental matrix (Arm A current Ktor baseline / Arm B raw OkHttp sequential / Arm C emulator parity / Arm D packet capture conditional / Phase 2 Arms E F G H I). Eight hard invariants enforced by code review: `Inv-NoProductionBehaviour`, `Inv-NoHeartbeatCadenceFix`, `Inv-NoAppLevelPingResurrection`, `Inv-NoTransportCapabilityChange`, `Inv-NoChainPolicyChange`, `Inv-RawArmReadOnly` (sequential-only after rev3), `Inv-ParallelArmIsolation` (parallel A+B forbidden after rev2 P1 grep-verified against `services/relay/src/routes.rs:230-232` `is_pubkey_hex` 64-hex constraint), `Inv-NoChangeUntilEvidence`. Four revisions (rev1 initial draft from audit convergence; rev2 5-point audit-driven amendments; rev3 4-point stale-fragment cleanup; rev4 1-point Arm A consistency cleanup).

**PR #266 squash `08514aee`** — Phase 1 Arm B diagnostic code. 4 files +489 lines, zero production WS path edits. NEW `apps/android/.../diagnostic/RcDirectArmB.kt` raw OkHttp `newWebSocket(...)` sequential diagnostic — own `OkHttpClient` with identical builder params to production (`pingInterval(15s)` / `readTimeout(60s)` / `connectTimeout(5s)` / `callTimeout(10s)` / `HTTP_1_1`), reconnect loop, `WebSocketListener` with `RC_DIRECT_ARM_B_*` log prefix, read-only (`webSocket.send(...)` never called). NEW `BuildConfig.DEBUG_RC_DIRECT_ARM` via `apps/android/build.gradle.kts` with values `"0"` / `"B"` / `"E"`, release-pinned to `"0"`. EDIT `AppContainer.kt` `internal val rcDirectArmB by lazy`. EDIT `PhantomMessagingService.kt` short-circuit at `onStartCommand` before `TransportManager.connect()` + teardown at `onDestroy` (closes Vladislav P1 lifecycle bug — OkHttp WS reader runs on its own dispatcher pool thread, so `WebSocket.cancel()` explicit teardown is required; coroutine cancellation alone does NOT interrupt the kernel `recv()`). APK SHA baseline `444639626e964b...` (recorded in the PR #266 commit body as the default-flag build; an Arm B `"B"`-flag variant was built locally for verification at PR time but not recorded in the PR body).

**This PR (docs)** — Phase 1 evidence summary §13-§18 appended to `docs/tracks/rc-direct-ws-death1.md`. Sequential v11 capture set: Arm A Tecno Tele2 LTE (29 sessions × ~31 s × after 0 pp); Arm A emulator Wi-Fi via host PC (0 OkHttp ping timeouts in 15 min — emulator did NOT reproduce); Arm B Tecno Tele2 LTE (13 sessions × 30-45 s × after 0-1 pp — matches Arm A Tele2 severity); Arm B Tecno Wi-Fi (5 sessions × ~150 s × after 8 pp — **numerically reproduces v9 Wi-Fi baseline within ~5 s**). Two distinct failure modes identified on the same Tecno device: **Mode 1 "Wi-Fi 8-pong rhythm"** ~145-150 s (v9 production Ktor + v11 Arm B raw OkHttp both exhibit), **Mode 2 "Tele2 severe 0-1-pong rhythm"** ~31-45 s (v11 Arm A production Ktor + v11 Arm B raw OkHttp both exhibit). v11 is not a v8 baseline regression — v8 Tele2 was closer to Mode 1; the carrier condition itself swings.

**Phase 1 verdict (Vladislav-locked):**
- **Rules out:** Ktor adapter as primary cause (raw OkHttp reproduces both modes, does not survive longer than Ktor).
- **Rules in:** raw OkHttp / WS protocol-ping path is affected on Tecno (below Ktor, above relay-side Pong send proven by PR #259 Test #83 v7).
- **Still open:** network return-path loss vs Tecno / HiOS / device stack vs OkHttp internal handling — not discriminable without packet capture.
- **Do NOT claim:** carrier-independent severity / Tele2-only / server-side bug / device-only bug.

**Operational finding:** stock Android emulator image lacks `tcpdump` binary (`/system/bin/sh: tcpdump: inaccessible or not found`), so mini-lock §4 Arm D's emulator pcap path is blocked unless we image-swap to one with tcpdump. Combined with the Phase 1 emu non-reproduction outcome (mini-lock §5 row 4), **PCAPdroid on Tecno escalates to the primary packet-capture path for Phase 2**, with two explicit targets: Mode 1 capture window starts ~120 s in (watching the 9th Pong); Mode 2 capture window starts at session open (watching the 1st-2nd Pong).

**Next session = Phase 2 mini-lock section** appended to the same `docs/tracks/rc-direct-ws-death1.md` (single-source-of-truth per Vladislav-locked structure ACK), planning PCAPdroid capture with the two mode-specific targets above. 3.2b.1 code remains paused per `Inv-NoChangeUntilEvidence`; the Phase 1 outcome favours it as a UX shield but Phase 2 evidence may still localise a smaller fix at the client-stack root. CHIP1 remains parked at `78bd979e` throughout.

### 2026-06-02 (tue) · PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1 Commit 3.2b design rev4+rev5 MERGED — external-architect audits absorbed; RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1 sequencing locked before any 3.2b.1 code

PR #263 squash-merged at `f692cdcf` on 2026-06-02. Docs-only, single file `docs/tracks/ws-health-state.md`, +56/-25. Two stacked revisions on the 3.2b design note after two external architect audits (Codex memo and "Глобальный аудит транспортов мессенджеров" PDF) returned converged findings. **Rev4** — three audit-converged contract corrections: (a) `RestHealthMonitor` strict 60 s window dropped (REST timeouts themselves can approach 60 s) → combined `/send`+`/poll` consecutive-failure counter with stale-reset after 5 min of inactivity; (b) `BackgroundPathValidator` `≥1 inbound frame` criterion dropped (quiet chats have no inbound flow even on healthy WS) → success = auth + WS upgrade + stability window + no ping_timeout, `roundtripProven=false` until relay `/probe/ws` ships; (c) `ProbeRunner` no longer reaches into `TransportManager.prepareTransport` → new `TransportPathPreparer` lease pattern, live `TransportManager` never mutated by a probe. **Rev5** — five self-review cleanups of leftover rev3 phrases that contradicted rev4 amendments: rev2 P3 history line marked superseded; D9 outbound-queue-backlog trigger deferred to §12 parking lot (`RestHealthMonitor` has no `recordQueueDepth` input); commonMain/Android `TransportPathPreparer` boundary made explicit (interface + no-op default in commonMain, real subsystem-reuse in `AndroidTransportPathPreparer`); gates #5 and #7 rewritten to match new contract. **Architectural conclusions unchanged across both revisions.** **Sequencing pivot:** next session is NOT 3.2b.1 code — both audits + Vladislav independently converged on opening `RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1` mini-lock first to localise where the 9th Pong is lost (6-arm matrix: current Ktor baseline / raw OkHttp `newWebSocket(...)` / Ktor `webSocketRaw` / app data-frame heartbeat diagnostic-only / packet capture on Tecno + relay logs / emulator + second handset parity). 3.2b.1 may be deprioritised if root cause turns out to be a localised OkHttp/Ktor or Tecno-stack fix; becomes a necessary UX shield if root cause is server-side / Hetzner / MTU.

### 2026-06-01 (mon, late) · PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1 Commit 3.2b design rev1→rev3 MERGED — Adaptive Path Validation reframe after Council + v9 + v10

PR #262 squash-merged at `ad3476ae` on 2026-06-01. Docs-only, single file, +247 lines. Supersedes the original "3.2b = chain-rewalk action layer" intent recorded in the 3.2a body. After LLM Council 5-lens pass and two field-test rounds, the action-layer premise "switching off Direct improves UX" is falsified for RU users on tested networks. **v9 (Tecno Ростелеком Wi-Fi, ~11 min) replicated v8 Tele2 LTE rhythm exactly: 5 sessions died at 145 s with 8 successful OkHttp ping/pongs each — carrier-independent.** **v10 (Tecno Ростелеком Wi-Fi, Private mode `REALITY_FIRST` chain): Reality `/health` probe full 20 s timeout, chain fallthrough to Tor with ~5 min wall clock to first WS auth, Direct REST proven 564 ms `/send` 201 in parallel.** Locked direction: **no automatic rewalk**; Direct stays in chain at all times (`reorderChain` unchanged); single chain-switch path is `currentKind==Direct AND restHealth.isFailing() AND validator.isValidatedRecently(kind)`; `TransportCapabilitiesResolver` (PR-C1) remains the sole calls gate (validator status is delivery-path fact only, never feeds capability resolver); Tor delivery-validated does NOT unlock calls. Rev2 added §3.1 capability boundary subsection with `Inv-CalleeReal` + `Inv-NoCapabilityShortcut`. Rev3 fixed two empirical-citation fact-refs (v8 line numbers were carried over from v7 file; v9 claim "no `WS_DEGRADED detected` gated lines" rewritten to acknowledge the one rising-edge verdict at `:374` with `gated_by_ws_candidate=false`). Three parallel tracks unlocked by v10: `RC-REALITY-PROBE1`, `RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1`, `PR-UI-CONNECTION-LABELS1`.

### 2026-06-01 (mon) · PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1 Commit 3.2a code MERGED — `WsDegradationDetector` telemetry-first; Test #83 v8 PASS

PR #261 squash-merged at `82103ad0` on 2026-06-01. Code shipped: `WsDegradationDetector` (commonMain, pure logic, sliding 5 min window, weighted events ping=2.0/ack=1.0/idle=0.6, Direct-only suspect lock at verdict construction, WsCandidate gate, mandatory session_total emission per close), `WsDegradationCollectorBindings` (androidMain helpers for the three Hybrid collectors), commonTest + androidUnitTest. APK SHA256 `f85fca7092ba32d0f4d8ba86f7643cb5a880651df35449d0e9b19e72a70b6266`. **Field-verified Test #83 v8 PASS on Tecno (`<redacted-device-serial>`) Tele2 LTE, ~12 min run.** All wire-confirm equalities held: `ws_passthrough_started=1`, `session_summary=4` matched `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY session_total=4` (mutex no race-induced loss), `okhttp_ping_timeout_detected=true=4` matched `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY counter kind=ping=4` (routing helper wired), `REST_TRACE mode_switched=3` matched `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY state_transition_seen=3` (P2-2 `onModeSwitched` wired). One `WS_DEGRADED detected` rising edge at minute 4 with `weighted_sum=4.6 state_machine=RestActive ping_timeout_count=2 idle_timeout_count=1 ack_timeout_count=0`. Telemetry-first split was the right call: the candidate `2 ping / 5 min` threshold from rev3 §5 fires on routine RU mobile noise floor (4 ping-timeouts in 8 min on Tele2 LTE / 5 in 11 min on Wi-Fi). Detector counters are calibration signal; action layer requires a different threshold derived from sustained-RestActive + recovery-absence (subsequently superseded by Adaptive Path Validation in #262).

### 2026-05-31 (sun, late) · PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1 Commit 3.3 code + 3.2a design + 3.1 UI MERGED — diagnostic + UI state foundation

Triple-merge on 2026-05-31: **PR #257 `3567d37a` Commit 3.1 UI** (`ConnectionUiState` derivation in `AppContainer` from `(RestMode, wsState)`; class-level `connectionRestMode: MutableStateFlow<RestMode>` source eliminates `combine` elvis-once trap; 7-row precedence table locked in `ConnectionUiStateTest` androidUnitTest with 15 cases including the 4 architect-flagged ambiguous cases — `(Connected, RestActive)→LimitedRealtime`, `(Connected, WsCandidate)→Recovering`, `(Reconnecting, RestActive)→LimitedRealtime`, `(Error, RestActive)→LimitedRealtime`). **PR #258 `f4501e89` Commit 3.3 design note** (ping/pong diagnostics ONLY; H-Ping3 elevated to primary hypothesis "OkHttp counter lies about ping/pong success"; client+relay structured logs locked with `WS_DEGRADED_TELEMETRY` family). **PR #259 `8727031f` Commit 3.3 code** — `PingTimeoutTextParser` (pure parser extracting N from OkHttp `SocketTimeoutException`'s "(after N successful ping/pongs)" message; clamps overflow to `Int.MAX_VALUE` instead of wrapping via `Long.toInt()`), `KtorRelayTransport.emitSessionSummary` second `relayLog` line emitting `ws_ping_timeout_diag` with `okhttp_ping_timeout_detected=<bool>` discriminator field, two `tracing::info!` lines in `services/relay/src/routes.rs` wrapping `Message::Pong` send so relay-side proves it sent the Pong. APK SHA `2f922f918a...`. **Test #83 v7 PASS** with 3-source capture (Tecno + emu + VPS relay logs): relay sends `ws_protocol_pong_sent` for the 9th Pong, but client OkHttp `okhttp_successful_ping_pongs=8`. What v7 proves: NOT a relay-side pong-send bug. What v7 does NOT prove: the open question — did the 9th Pong physically reach the device's socket buffer and get mis-counted by OkHttp / Ktor / Android stack, OR was it lost on the return-path between relay and device. Both possibilities feed `RC-DIRECT-WS-DEATH1` and require packet-capture parity to discriminate. Proximal kill mechanism is confirmed as OkHttp `RealWebSocket.writePingFrame()` firing on the NEXT ping after a missed pong (matches v7/v8/v9 exception text verbatim). Side-observation logged but parked: sealed-sender read receipts on Tecno fail MAC because `markConversationRead(...)` sends without `x3dhInit` and PR #249's inbound X3DH repair does not fire without it — separate track, hold until transport recovery ships.

### 2026-05-30 (sat) · PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1 mini-lock + Commit 2 fail-fast + 3.1 design MERGED — WS-HEALTH-STATE1 track opened

Track-opening day for PR-WS-HEALTH-STATE1: **PR #252 `222fffab` mini-lock** (three-section diagnosis from Test #83 v3 burst-delivery collapse on Tecno Tele2 LTE: §1 doказанные facts F1–F11 — three sequential WS sessions, session_summary ping counters reporting zero, idle_watchdog suppressing reconnect even at sinceLastPong > 2 min, REST `/send` retries hitting 60 s `InterruptedIOException`, REST `/poll` short-poll endpoint failing at 60 s, WS reconnect auth challenge failing twice with `SocketTimeoutException`; §2 hypothesis pool; §3 post-fix invariants including the fail-fast plan and WORKING_RULES rule-8 transport-regression gate). **PR #254 `e4ca1957` Commit 2 design note** (fail-fast numerics locked from `test83-v4` field data). **PR #255 `3a1e5b56` Commit 2 code** — short-message fail-fast ceilings + jittered backoff applied at 7 sites with computed-then-logged shape, `RelayTransportConfig` numerics: `WS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `WS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `WS_FIRST_FRAME_TIMEOUT_MS`, `WS_AUTH_TIMEOUT_MS`, `WS_AUTH_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `REST_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `REST_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS`. **Test #83 v5b / v5b1 field hard gates PASS:** no 60 s TLS stall, jitter band valid, no phantom `send_retry attempt=5`, healthy WS not killed by 10 s `callTimeout`. **PR #256 `d0522545` Commit 3.1 design note** — UI composite transport state ONLY (Path A: `AppContainer`-owned derivation, NOT `HybridRelayTransport`-owned; 8 acceptance gates including 7-row precedence + null-hybrid fallback).

### 2026-05-29 (fri, close) · PR-CRYPTO-INBOUND-X3DH-REPAIR1 MERGED — inbound X3DH repair gap closed; CHIP1 unblocked

PR #249 squash-merged at `1408cd75` on 2026-05-29 after the docs-only
mini-lock PR #248 (`fe90c8a9`) captured the Test #83 v2 diagnosis:
outbound repair from the emulator was working, but the Tecno receive path
ignored a fresh `wireFrame.x3dhInit` whenever a stale local ratchet session
already existed. The result was `x3dhInitPresent=true` followed by MAC failure
and hold instead of accepting the repair hint.

**What shipped (squashed in PR #249):**

- `SessionManager.recipientBootstrapInMemory(...)` derives a recipient
  bootstrap candidate without persisting it. The API returns a non-null
  `RatchetState` and preserves typed `SessionBootstrapException` failures for
  logging.
- `DefaultMessagingService.handleDeliver` now tries the normal existing-session
  decrypt first. If that fails with MAC / verification and the envelope carries
  `x3dhInit`, it derives a candidate ratchet in memory, candidate-decrypts the
  same encrypted payload, and saves the advanced ratchet state only after that
  decrypt succeeds. The success path then flows through the normal downstream
  message handling and ACK path.
- Failure path preserves the old ratchet row byte-for-byte, does not set
  `session_suspect` inside the new repair branch, and falls through to the
  existing PR #243 hold branch. `CancellationException` is rethrown so coroutine
  cancellation cannot be converted into repair failure / destructive ACK
  behavior.
- Dedicated DMS integration tests cover success, no-`x3dhInit`, no-existing
  session, and the central stale-session failure invariant: stale session +
  inbound `x3dhInit` + candidate decrypt failure leaves the pre-receive ratchet
  blob byte-identical.

**Verification:** local JVM verification was green for
`:shared:core:messaging:jvmTest` + `:shared:core:storage:jvmTest`
(`52` DMS + `14` SessionManager + `46` other messaging + `52` storage =
`164` tests, 0 failures), and `:apps:android:assembleDebug` was green. PR
CI was green on head `5d84da3e`. Changed files were limited to four
`shared/core/messaging` files; no UI, transport, DB/schema, CHIP1, or relay
code moved in this track.

**Follow-up discipline:** CHIP1 is unblocked but intentionally not continued in
this session. Next session should start cleanly from `master` at `1408cd75`,
rebase `feat/pr-ui-chat-new-msg-chip1`, rebuild the APK, and rerun Test #83's
10 CHIP scenarios. `stash@{0}` contains the CHIP1 hand-off edit and remains
untouched until Vladislav explicitly decides whether to use it. Expected crypto
sanity on the next Tecno run: `DECRYPT_TRACE attempt sessionExists=true
x3dhInitPresent=true` → `DECRYPT_TRACE inbound_repair_ok bootstrap=true`, then
the CHIP assertion `CHAT_CHIP incoming conv=<8> count=1` when scrolled up.

Stabilization Sprint queue after this close: **PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1** →
**RENDER-PERF1** (conditional) → **NOTIF-POLICY1** → **D1e**.

### 2026-05-29 (fri, late) · Out-of-queue: phntm.pro site replace + funding.json donation URL fix — both LIVE in single deploy sweep

Two out-of-queue PRs deployed back-to-back in one VPS sweep, ahead of resuming the Stabilization Sprint queue at PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1.

**PR #245 `3109126f` — funding.json donation URL typo fix.** Two URLs were silently 404ing since the file shipped in PR #215 / #221:
- Liberapay was `liberapay.com/phantom-messenger` (lowercase p) → fixed to `liberapay.com/Phantom-messenger` (capital P; Liberapay handles are case-sensitive in the URL).
- Buy Me a Coffee was `buymeacoffee.com/phantommessenger` (old handle) → fixed to `buymeacoffee.com/phantompro` (Vladislav changed the BMAC handle).

2-line diff in `funding.json`, JSON validity re-checked, schema unchanged at v1.1.0. CI 3/3 green; merged on Rule 9 typo carve-out (architect ACK + Vladislav-explicit "обновить в репо") without an architect-thread re-review round.

**PR #246 `dd0b3dce` — phntm.pro static site replacing the stub landing.** Replaces the prior placeholder (`<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow">` + "Alpha invites coming soon" + `hello@phntm.pro` email) with the full project site authored by Vladislav at `D:\VL Stories Studio\phantom-site-final\`:

- **Four pages**, bilingual EN / RU: `index.html` (hero / features / privacy modes / transports / status), `about.html` (mission / how-built / who-builds), `roadmap.html` (Shipped / In progress / Planned), `donate.html` (channels + crypto copy-buttons for BTC / XMR / ETH).
- **Each HTML self-contained** — CSS + JS inlined, logo embedded as base64 data URI. CDN dependencies only for fonts (Inter + JetBrains Mono via Google Fonts, Geist via jsdelivr) with fallback fonts in the family stack.
- **Browser-language autodetect** + manual EN / RU switcher with `localStorage` persistence. Scroll-reveal + hover-lift animations (`prefers-reduced-motion` respected). Clipboard-copy for crypto addresses.
- **`<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">` baked into every `<head>`** as defense-in-depth against any reverse-proxy / CDN inheritance of the old stub's `noindex,nofollow` directive. The new robots meta lands in both the four committed HTML files AND the four `.build/build_*.py` regen scripts so future rebuilds preserve it.
- **`site/static/` (NOT `assets/`)** — Caddy on phntm.pro has a dedicated `handle_path /assets/*` route that proxies to `/srv/legal/assets/` for the legal pages (`/terms`, `/privacy`). Using `assets/` for site files would silently 404 any future `<img src="assets/...">` reference. Currently invisible at runtime because every HTML embeds the logo as base64 inline, but the build scripts already write `static/phantom-logo.jpg` so any future build that decides to use external images instead of base64 will work without surprise.
- **`site/.build/` (NOT `_build_scripts/`)** — Caddy `file_server` hides dot-prefix files by default; underscore-prefix is NOT auto-hidden. Dot-prefix keeps the build artefacts versioned in git but invisible at `https://phntm.pro/.build/*` (404 instead of 200 with directory listing).

**Roadmap security wording precision fix** during final review. Drafts had "Eight P1 security findings closed (keystore-wrap, signed auth, key rotation)" — the "Eight" count was not verifiable against ADR-023 / ADR-024 / ADR-027 evidence (which cover 4 findings across 3 ADRs: F22 prekey wrap, F8 ratchet state wrap, F11 + F26 signed-challenge auth). Reworded to verifiable form per Vladislav 2026-05-29:
- EN: "Multiple P1 cryptographic findings resolved: prekey wrap, ratchet state wrap, signed-challenge authentication."
- RU: "Усиление безопасности — закрыты P1-находки по криптографии: оборачивание prekey, оборачивание состояния ratchet, подписанная аутентификация."

Both `roadmap.html` and `.build/build_roadmap.py` updated together so future regenerations preserve the precision.

**Single-sweep deploy** on Hetzner VPS at 2026-05-29 closed BOTH PRs in one `git pull` + `docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy` + one Cloudflare Dashboard purge:

```
cd /home/phantom/Phantom && git pull
cd deploy && docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy
# Cloudflare Dashboard → phntm.pro → Caching → Configuration → Purge Everything
```

`--force-recreate` required because `funding.json` is a single-file bind-mount (inode trap from PR #218 / #219 / #221 — container holds original inode after `git pull` overwrites the file on disk). The site uses a directory bind-mount which is less fragile but the same `--force-recreate` covers both.

**Four `curl` verify checks all PASS on the live host** (output captured from `phantom@phantom-relay-01`):

1. `curl -sL https://phntm.pro/ | grep '<meta name="robots"'` → `<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">` ✅
2. `curl -sL https://phntm.pro/ | grep -i 'noindex'` → empty ✅
3. `curl -s https://phntm.pro/funding.json | grep -E 'liberapay|buymeacoffee'` → `Phantom-messenger` (capital P) + `phantompro` ✅
4. `curl -sI https://phntm.pro/{about,roadmap,donate}.html | head -1` → HTTP/2 200 on all three ✅

**docker-compose change** (one line in `services.caddy.volumes`):
- Was: `./landing:/srv/landing:ro`
- Is now: `../site:/srv/landing:ro`

Container path `/srv/landing` unchanged → Caddyfile root path stays correct, **no Caddyfile edit required**. The previous `deploy/landing/` directory stays in git history as historical artefact but is no longer bind-mounted; revert that single line to roll back.

**What is NOT changed** (preserved across deploy):
- `funding.json` at repo root — already separately bind-mounted as `../funding.json:/srv/funding/funding.json:ro` and served at `https://phntm.pro/funding.json` by a dedicated Caddyfile `handle`.
- `.well-known/funding-manifest-urls` at repo root — for the FLOSS/fund GitHub wellKnown proof only. NOT served via phntm.pro.
- `deploy/well-known/assetlinks.json` — Android App Links manifest, separately bind-mounted to `/srv/well-known`.
- Caddy auto-managed `.well-known/acme-challenge/` and the `caddy_data` named volume (Let's Encrypt certs + keys).

**Process gates that fired:**

- **WORKING_RULES Rule 8** (transport regression gate): carve-out applies on both PRs — docs / site / funding.json changes don't touch transport chain selection or reconnect lifecycle.
- **WORKING_RULES Rule 9** (no merge without verification): PR #245 merged on typo carve-out (Vladislav-explicit "обновить в репо" + 2-line diff). PR #246 merged after a 7-section grep-verified checklist (structure / paths, HTML content, donate URLs, build-script sync, docker-compose surgical edit, Caddyfile-not-touched, README) + CI 3/3 green + explicit Vladislav "го" greenlight. Drafts source authoring attribution preserved in PR body and commit message.

**Stabilization Sprint queue** — unchanged. Next: **PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1** (position #3, mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-new-msg-chip.md`; branch `feat/pr-ui-chat-new-msg-chip1` carries early scaffold from pre-Stabilization-Sprint period — diff against current master before reusing). Master HEAD after this docs PR: pending merge.

### 2026-05-29 (fri) · PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1 MERGED — hold MAC errors instead of ack-and-lose; replay after fresh X3DH; 24h local TTL

PR #243 squash-merged at `a292ac4f` on 2026-05-29T05:48:09Z after eight architect ACK rounds (commits 1+2 plumbing, 3a hold branch, 3b/3c invariant tests, 4 fresh X3DH, 5 replay loop, 5a Replay Safety Patch, 5b Replay Ratchet Commit Ordering, 6 24h TTL eviction) plus an explicit final-merge ACK and an explicit Vladislav greenlight on the merge step. Closes the silent-message-loss class first hardened in agent memory as `bug_force_stop_ratchet_corruption_2026_05_27.md`: on Tecno after force-stop / re-install cycles, the receiver's persisted Double Ratchet state drifted away from the sender's view, the next incoming envelope hit `Permanent decrypt failure (MAC error)`, the existing receive path ack-delivered it and wrote `processed_envelopes.FAILED_MAC`, and the message was silently lost — only working remediation up to this PR was `pm clear phantom.android` (identity wipe).

**Production behavior unchanged.** The new path is gated on `holdMacFailures = phantom.android.BuildConfig.DEBUG` wired in `AppContainer.kt`. Release APKs keep the existing ack-on-MAC + FAILED_MAC code path completely intact. Debug / beta APKs (where `BuildConfig.DEBUG == true`) now run the hold → suspect → fresh X3DH → bounded-replay → 24h-TTL cycle.

**What shipped (17 commits squashed):**

- **Storage layer (commit 1, `94d5e7ff`)** — new SqlDelight table `decrypt_failed_envelopes` (forward-only migration `18.sqm`) and two new columns on `conversation` (`session_suspect`, `session_suspect_set_at_ms`, migration `19.sqm`). Repository interface + impl + in-memory test fake. Zero behaviour change. Both columns default `0 / NULL`; the new table starts empty. Existing rows survive untouched on upgrade.
- **Observability + DI wiring (commit 2, `7825fa3b`)** — `DefaultMessagingService` constructor gains `holdMacFailures: Boolean = false` + `decryptFailedEnvelopeRepository: DecryptFailedEnvelopeRepository? = null`. `AppContainer.kt` instantiates `SqlDelightDecryptFailedEnvelopeRepository(dbHolder.database)` and passes it to DMS alongside `holdMacFailures = BuildConfig.DEBUG`. Six `DECRYPT_TRACE` log lines added at decrypt decision points — flag plumbed but unused this commit, observability only.
- **Hold branch in `handleDeliver` (commits 3a/3b/3c, `8404e9c5` + `1599b351` + `22af5d7b` + `0362e782`)** — additive `if (holdMacFailures && repo != null)` branch BEFORE the existing ack + markProcessed code in the MAC-error site. The hold branch persists the inner `WireFrame` JSON to `decrypt_failed_envelopes`, marks `conversation.session_suspect = true`, and does NOT ack and does NOT markProcessed. The `else` branch (release: `holdMacFailures = false`) keeps the current ack-on-MAC + FAILED_MAC path completely unchanged. Architect P2 from 3a (3c) relocated the destructive-ack warning INTO the release-only branch where it actually applies. Five-test invariant matrix shipped in 3b + 3c: hold-in-debug, ack-on-release, normal-debug, normal-release, byte-level `wire_frame_json` regression — all green.
- **Suspect-driven fresh X3DH (commit 4, `e42bb0ca`)** — when the next outgoing in a `session_suspect = true` conversation enters `encryptUnderLock`, it forces a fresh X3DH bootstrap regardless of any cached ratchet state. Per-conversation `mutexFor(conversationId)` (architect pre-decision #1, reuse-existing-mutex) serializes the repair. The suspect flag is cleared ONLY after the local `saveSession(newState)` commit succeeds — not after `transport.send`. Architect-locked: if anything between bootstrap and `saveSession` throws, the suspect flag stays `true` so the NEXT outgoing retries the repair.
- **Replay loop after successful repair (commits 5 / 5a / 5b, `8ad94320` + `679e7347` + `b24b09a7`)** — `replayHeldEnvelopesAfterRepair` runs inside the same per-conversation mutex immediately after `clearSessionSuspect`. The final shape after 5a Safety Patch + 5b Ratchet Commit Ordering is: decode WireFrame → load fresh session → `ratchet.decrypt` IN MEMORY → decode `MessagePayload` → require `TYPE_MESSAGE` → insert text row with disappearing-timer expiry → **`saveSession(newState)`** → upsert conversation + emit `_incomingMessages` + notification callback → markProcessed → ack → delete held row. Failures at steps 1–6 return `false` BEFORE `saveSession`, leaving the receive chain un-advanced so the same row remains decryptable on the next replay cycle.
- **24h local TTL eviction (commit 6, `4378c462`)** — new `HELD_ENVELOPE_TTL_MS = 24h` constant next to `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS_PER_HELD = 3L` on the companion. Opportunistic `deleteOlderThan(nowMs - HELD_ENVELOPE_TTL_MS)` runs BEFORE `listByConversation` at the entry of `replayHeldEnvelopesAfterRepair`. Sweep failure is non-fatal (logged; surviving rows still get their decrypt attempts). LOCAL cleanup only — no `sendDeliveryAck`, no `markProcessed`, no `setSessionSuspect`. Relay-side envelope TTL is separate and authoritative.

**Architect invariants enforced and test-covered (final replay loop):**

1. **Outer per-envelope guard** (5a): no replay exception escapes back into `encryptUnderLock`. The trigger-send that drove the repair is NEVER aborted by replay failure. `recordReplayAttempt` is itself `runCatching`-wrapped.
2. **Strict step order** (5b): insert is the durability gate; `saveSession` runs ONLY after the durable text insert succeeds. Insert-fail / complex-payload / payload-decode-fail return BEFORE `saveSession`, leaving the receive chain un-advanced. Verified by `replay_insert_failure_does_not_advance_ratchet` and `replay_complex_payload_does_not_advance_ratchet` using a marker `MarkingPassthroughDoubleRatchet` whose `decrypt` returns a state with a recognizable `receivingChainKey = ByteArray(32) { 0x55 }`.
3. **Anti-loop guarantee** (architect pre-decision #3 invariant 4): NO failure path EVER re-sets `session_suspect`. A failed replay does not retrigger another bootstrap. Verified by 4 separate tests.
4. **Diagnostic cap + safety net**: `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS_PER_HELD = 3` (architect-locked diagnostic cap) and `HELD_ENVELOPE_TTL_MS = 24h` (primary safety net). Capped attempts protect against tight loop on a single bootstrap; TTL is the cleanup for accumulated stale rows.
5. **Per-conversation scope + mutex serialization**: replay only touches rows for the conversation that just got repaired; all paths run inside the existing `mutexFor(conversationId)` — no concurrent ratchet races.
6. **Disappearing-timer mirror** (5b): replayed text rows inherit `expiresAtMs = nowMs + timerSecs * 1000` using the same formula as the live-receive path at `handleDeliver` lines ~2820–2840.
7. **Complex-payload handling** (5a tightened): non-`TYPE_MESSAGE` payloads stay held + recordAttempt + ratchet un-advanced + no ack + no delete. Commit 5's earlier "ack + delete on complex" would have silently discarded payloads the user never sees. Group / voice chunk / reaction / pin replay UI handlers deferred to a follow-up commit; the un-advanced ratchet means the same `WireFrame` remains decryptable when that handler ships.

**Test #87 manual MAC repro — honest status:** The triggering bug (`Permanent decrypt failure (MAC error)` after multiple force-stop + re-install cycles on the Tecno receiver) is **not deterministically reproducible on demand**. The original repro was naturally occurring after a multi-day force-stop pattern accumulating ratchet drift; standard manual force-stop + reinstall during the final-hardening window did not reproduce the MAC mismatch. The PR's correctness rests on the 48-test invariant matrix. Post-merge observation point: a row appearing in `decrypt_failed_envelopes` on any debug / beta install is the diagnostic signal that the bug actually fired on a real device — the hold table itself is the empirical reproducer that was missing during final hardening.

**Locked process gates that fired:**

- **WORKING_RULES Rule 8** (transport regression gate): carve-out applies — this PR is crypto-only and does not touch chain selection / reconnect lifecycle / network-change / probes / WS-REST fallback. Documented in the PR body under "Architectural rationale".
- **WORKING_RULES Rule 9** (no merge without verification): eight architect ACK rounds on the PR thread, one per commit (1+2 plumbing, 3a, 3b/3c invariant tests, 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 6) + an explicit final-merge ACK. Each round produced grep-verified fix mappings on the PR comment thread. PR body rewritten at final hardening to reflect actual landed state (stale "commit 3 not landed" wording removed).

**Architectural rationale preserved in PR body and mini-lock** (`docs/tracks/crypto-session-repair.md`):

- Per-conversation mutex reuse (pre-decision #1): repair piggybacks on existing `mutexFor(conversationId)`, not a parallel `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- Receive ack ownership stays in DMS (pre-decision #2): `SessionRepairService` as a separate file was preserved as an option but not split in this PR. Repair logic stays inline in `DefaultMessagingService`, scoped to `encryptUnderLock` + `replayHeldEnvelopesAfterRepair`.
- 24h TTL as the primary limiter, 3-attempt cap as the diagnostic guard (pre-decision #3 cont.).
- Forward-only migrations (commit 1): rollback safe without schema rollback since new columns default `0 / NULL` and the new table stays empty if the new code is never executed.

### 2026-05-28 (thu, late) · PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1 MERGED — Event.NetworkChanged wired + TransportRewalkCoordinator + LTE attribution diagnostics

PR #241 `899d45bd` merged after three architect review rounds (functional Test #88 PASS on Tecno Tele2 LTE) and three additive commits preserving the verification trail (`61b4da0b` initial impl → `ea9b74a4` 3 P1 fixes → `b340eba5` P2 fix + KDoc nit). Closes the dead-handler gap empirically reproduced in PR #240's baseline Scenario B (zero `NETWORK_TRACE` lines, no fresh `chain_start` after Wi-Fi → LTE).

**What shipped:**

- **New files** (2, ~430 lines): `NetworkChangeObserver` (single `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback` per process, 1500 ms debounce, then fresh `activeNetwork` snapshot read rather than callback payload, 4-axis meaningful-change classifier) and `TransportRewalkCoordinator` (8-step rewalk owned outside `HybridRelayTransport`: rate-limit gate → log start → clear hint → submit `Event.NetworkChanged` → `disconnect` → `transportManager.release` → request service restart → log done).
- **Service re-entry contract:** new `EXTRA_REWALK_RESTART` / `EXTRA_REWALK_REASON` intent extras on `PhantomMessagingService`. Coordinator triggers re-entry via `startService(Intent(...).putExtra(EXTRA_REWALK_RESTART, true))`; service force-resets `connectStarted` CAS before the normal `onStartCommand` flow runs. Single source of truth for entering the connect lifecycle stays in `onStartCommand`.
- **Hybrid narrow contract:** `HybridRelayTransport.submitNetworkChangedEvent()` — one-line suspend method that forwards `Event.NetworkChanged` to the state machine. Hybrid does NOT touch preferences / disconnect / release / restart. Owning all of that there would make it a god-object; the coordinator owns it instead.
- **LTE attribution:** `PROBE_TRACE reality_filtered reason=vpn_active` line on `TransportManager` when Reality is dropped due to VPN. Direct probe phase events via `OkHttpClient.Builder().eventListener(ProbeEventListener(TransportKind.Direct))` mirroring the existing Ktor probe pattern at `KtorTransportProbe.kt:170`. Test #88 Scenario D's 5.8-minute Tor wait is now log-explainable: every phase that died is visible.
- **Generation token for CAS race** (P1-3 architect finding): `connectGeneration: AtomicLong`. Each `serviceScope.launch` claims a token via `incrementAndGet()` after CAS succeeds; cleanup sites route through `resetConnectStartedIfCurrent(myGen, site)` that only resets `connectStarted` if the current generation matches. A cancelled stale generation cannot clobber the CAS while a fresher one is alive.
- **Atomic register/unregister** (P2 architect finding): `synchronized(registrationLock)` block in `NetworkChangeObserver.register()` and `unregister()` closes the check-then-act race that produced duplicate `observer_registered` lines in Test #88 A/B/D. The redundant `onCreate` registration path is also removed — `onStartCommand`'s post-init success branch is now the single canonical registration entry point.

**Three architect guardrails enforced in code** (locked 2026-05-28):

1. **Ownership separation.** Coordinator owns reset; Service owns connect lifecycle re-entry; Hybrid owns only the state-machine event handoff.
2. **Debounce, then fresh snapshot.** Observer reads `ConnectivityManager.activeNetwork` + capabilities after the debounce window elapses — NOT the callback payload. Trivial changes (signal jitter, MTU) dropped via 4-axis classifier with `NETWORK_TRACE callback_ignored reason=trivial_change`.
3. **`networkPresent=false → true` bypasses rate-limit.** `isForcedReason = reason == NETWORK_AVAILABLE || (!lastNetworkPresent && snapshot.networkPresent)`. Logged as `forced=true` in `rewalk_start`.

**New structured log keys** (all verified absent in master `74fc95f6` and added in this PR):

Tag distribution: `NETWORK_TRACE` under `PhantomHybrid`; `PROBE_TRACE reality_filtered` under `TransportManager`; `PROBE_TRACE probe_event` from Direct probe under `TransportProbe`.

**Test #88 verdicts on Tecno Tele2 LTE** (logs at `C:\temp\test88-*.log` on Vladislav's Windows PC, 8 files total, real-device artefacts NOT in repo):

- **Scenario A — cold-start raw Tele2 LTE:** PASS. Direct probe success ~0.9 s, `Online via Direct · Standard`, message delivered + `Decrypt OK`. WS still flaps via ping timeout (known LTE realtime-quality issue, not this PR's scope).
- **Scenario B — Wi-Fi → LTE swap, THE critical gate:** PASS. Log sequence verified: `NETWORK_TRACE changed old=WIFI new=CELLULAR resolvedReason=WIFI_TO_CELLULAR` → `rewalk_start reason=WIFI_TO_CELLULAR` → `service_restart_received reason=WIFI_TO_CELLULAR — resetting connectStarted CAS` → `generation_claimed gen=2` → fresh `PROBE_TRACE chain_start ordered=[Direct, Reality, Tor]`. This is exactly what was absent in the pre-PR baseline.
- **Scenario C — LTE + VPN:** PASS as architect-defined expected. `ordered=[Direct, Tor] vpnActive=true realityFiltered=true`, dedicated `PROBE_TRACE reality_filtered reason=vpn_active` line emitted, Direct probe succeeded second try, message delivered. Tor not attempted because Direct succeeded — this is correct fallback semantics.
- **Scenario D — force-stop LTE no VPN:** PASS. Direct timeout × 2, Reality timeout, Tor success after `totalMs ≈ 5.8 min`, message delivered + `Decrypt OK` after Tor came up. Correct fallback. `probe_event` phase logs now make each failure attributable from logs alone.
- **MAC error did NOT recur** in any scenario. `PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1` remains queued behind this PR as a separate track.

**Locked process gates that fired** (durable record):

- **WORKING_RULES Rule 8** (transport regression gate): Test #88 PASS on real Tecno Tele2 LTE hardware before merge. Wi-Fi-only PASS would not have been sufficient — Scenario B is the load-bearing reproducer that only exists on a real network change.
- **WORKING_RULES Rule 9** (no merge without verification): three architect review rounds on the PR thread (direction approval → P1 line-level review → P2 final review). Each round produced grep-verified fix mappings on the PR comment thread. The previous default of "I merged on CI green before architect reviewed" (which produced PRs #238/#239) did NOT happen here.

**Stabilization Sprint queue advances.** PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1 (position #1) is now ✅ DONE. **Next: PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1** (mini-lock at `docs/tracks/crypto-session-repair.md`, queue position #2, MAC-error session repair without `pm clear` wipe — bug at `bug_force_stop_ratchet_corruption_2026_05_27.md` in agent memory). After SESSION-REPAIR1 the rest of the Stabilization Sprint queue continues per `feedback_android_stabilization_sprint.md`: CHIP1 (resume on `feat/pr-ui-chat-new-msg-chip1` branch) → RENDER-PERF1 (conditional) → NOTIF-POLICY1 → D1e.

**Three commits' verification trail preserved in PR history** (additive, not force-pushed): `61b4da0b` → `ea9b74a4` (3 P1 fixes — observer-register race, FIRST_SNAPSHOT destructive rewalk, CAS stale-cleanup) → `b340eba5` (P2 atomic register/unregister + KDoc nit). Three architect approval points on the PR thread. This is the Rule 9 pattern future PRs should follow.

### 2026-05-28 (thu) · Tele2 LTE baseline diagnostic — verdicts confirm PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1 scope, do NOT alter mini-lock

Pre-implementation baseline gathered on master `6919b91a` (APK MD5 `d3b7880dc37516ce49330fceda574316` — byte-identical to PR-RECV-DIAG1 Test #86 APK, no source changes since `684c2be6`). Four scenarios on Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` (real device, Tele2 LTE Иркутская) paired with `emulator-5554` on dev Wi-Fi.

**Goal.** Empirically verify the external transport architect's three code-state diagnoses against actual hardware on Tele2 LTE BEFORE coding PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1, so the implementation targets real bugs and not assumed ones. The diagnostic was authored as a runbook with explicit logcat tag coverage (`PhantomMessaging:V PhantomMessagingService:V PhantomTransport:V PhantomHybrid:V PhantomRelay:V PhantomWakeup:V TransportManager:V TransportProbe:V RestStateMachine:V`) after a Rule 9 grep verified that `TransportProbe` + `PhantomMessagingService` + `PhantomWakeup` (note: tag is `PhantomWakeup`, not `PhantomWakeupReceiver`) were missing from the previous canonical command. Spot-check of the four log files by independent grep on this end confirmed the architect's findings line-by-line.

**Scenario A — cold-start raw Tele2 LTE, no Wi-Fi, no VPN.** PASS. Direct probe succeeded in ~0.9 s, `Online via Direct · Standard`, `setup-*` message delivered + `Decrypt OK`. But WS subsequently died several times via `sent ping but didn't receive pong` (24 instances in the log) — app survived via REST fallback (PR-RECV-DIAG1 v1.6 InboundIdleTimeout path doing its job). Verdict: **Tele2 LTE does NOT fundamentally kill Direct**; it makes Direct WS intermittently flap, and the existing REST fallback machinery is what keeps the channel alive.

**Scenario B — Wi-Fi → LTE mid-session swap.** Architect-explicit critical scenario. Direct on Wi-Fi worked; pre-swap message delivered. After Wi-Fi off, **zero `NETWORK_TRACE` lines and zero new `PROBE_TRACE chain_start`** in the log (independently grep-confirmed: `count=0`). Post-swap message still got through, but via REST fallback rather than a fresh chain walk. **Confirmed empirically:** `Event.NetworkChanged` is a dead handler exactly as architect diagnosed. This is the load-bearing reproducer that justifies `PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1`.

**Scenario C — LTE + VPN active.** Reality correctly filtered: `ordered=[Direct, Tor] vpnActive=true realityFiltered=true` (verified at `diag-tele2-C-tecno.log:45-46`). First Direct probe timed out, second succeeded, message delivered via Direct. **Confirmed expected behaviour.** The `realityFiltered=true` already in master is correct; the gap is the additional explicit `PROBE_TRACE reality_filtered reason=vpn_active` line (which the mini-lock already calls for).

**Scenario D — force-stop cycle, LTE no VPN.** Direct timed out twice, Reality timed out, **Tor eventually succeeded after `totalMs=348946` ≈ 5.8 minutes** (`chain_start` at `01:18:05.468` → `chain_attempt_success kind=Tor` at `01:24:35.333`). Message delivered immediately after Tor came up. UX during the 5.8-minute wait: `Connecting...` with no attribution. The chain-fallback behaviour is correct (Tor genuinely came up only after Direct + Reality genuinely failed — NOT a sticky-hint regression); the UX is poor because there is no probe-phase attribution log to explain why Direct/Reality failed and how far each got.

**MAC error did NOT recur in any of the four scenarios.** All received messages produced `Decrypt OK`. `PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1` remains a valid separate track but its reproducer needs a more specific sequence than a single force-stop cycle (architect-noted: multi-cycle force-stop + reinstall + queued envelope + stale session).

**Verdicts (per the decision tree from the runbook):**

| Decision-tree cell | Observation | Implied action |
|---|---|---|
| A: cold LTE | 🟢 Direct OK (with REST fallback for WS flap) | LTE-NETCHANGE1 does NOT need to "fix Direct on LTE" |
| B: Wi-Fi → LTE | 🔴 no NETWORK_TRACE, no new chain_start | **LTE-NETCHANGE1 is justified** by this reproducer alone |
| C: LTE + VPN | 🟢 Reality filtered correctly | Confirms existing behaviour; mini-lock's reality_filtered reason log still useful |
| D: force-stop LTE | 🟡 Tor fallback after 5.8 minutes, correct but opaque | LTE-NETCHANGE1's diagnostics-hardening Step 5 directly addresses this |

**Queue order — unchanged:** `PR-LTE-NETCHANGE1` → `PR-CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1`. Baseline confirms B is the load-bearing reproducer; D confirms attribution-hardening is genuinely needed; the mini-lock at `docs/tracks/lte-netchange.md` (post-#239) covers all three findings without rewrite. Architect-revised framing of the PR title ("при смене сети делать fresh rewalk + давать понятную attribution-диагностику + не зависать на старом WS / старом socks / старом transport decision") is a clearer summary of what the 5-step implementation actually does; the mini-lock's existing steps map onto each piece exactly.

**Logs preserved at** `C:\temp\diag-tele2-{A,B,C,D}-{tecno,emu}.log` on Vladislav's Windows ПК (8 files total). Not in the repo (real-device logs are not source artifacts), but referenced from the next implementation PR description as the empirical baseline.

**No code or mini-lock changes from this entry.** This entry exists only as the durable reference for "we did baseline first, the bug is real, the mini-lock matches reality" — load-bearing context the implementation PR will cite.

### 2026-05-27 (wed) · PR-RECV-DIAG1 MERGED — Direct transport restored, inbound-stall fallback, init race fix

PR #234 `684c2be6` merged after Test #86 PASS on Tecno real device. Eight-commit diagnostic-to-fix arc (`e761c699` → `7e3d3c4e`) on `diag/pr-recv-diag1` that started as a "messages stopped arriving on Tecno" investigation and ended with a fix to a sticky-fallback-hint regression in `TransportManager` plus two new recovery paths in the WS data plane.

**Root cause (v1.7 fix, the main one):** `TransportManager.reorderChain()` was hoisting ANY `lastWorkingTransport` to first position. A single successful Tor fallback after a transient network glitch then locked the client to a 24h sticky preference (`TransportPreferences.LAST_SUCCESS_TTL_MS`) → on every subsequent app start `ordered=[Tor, Direct, Reality]` → Tor probe succeeded → Direct was never tried → `onSuccess` re-saved Tor and refreshed the TTL → self-reinforcing loop forever. The fix: save the hint only when `kind == strategy.chain.first()`. Fallback successes now clear the hint. `reorderChain` also clears non-primary hints on load. Added `PROBE_TRACE hint_read / hint_ignored / hint_kept / hint_saved / hint_not_saved` diagnostic lines under tag `TransportManager`. New tests `fallbackHintIsClearedAndDoesNotHoistOverPrimary` and `primaryHintIsKeptAndPrimaryProbesFirst` replaced the obsolete `lastWorkingHintReordersChain` which had encoded the opposite (broken) semantics.

**Secondary fix (v1.8): inbound-stall triggers bootstrap retry.** When the WS session is open but no frames arrive for 60+ s AND REST capability is false (bootstrap failed at start due to `session_challenge_fail SocketTimeoutException`), the v1.6 `InboundStalledEvent` collector was silently returning because of the `restCapabilityActive` guard. Neither REST poll started (no capability) nor was bootstrap re-attempted (the only retry path was `wsSessionEnded`). v1.8 has the collector call `maybeRetryBootstrap()` instead — same path the wsSessionEnded branch already uses, just gated on a different trigger. Rate-limited via the existing `BOOTSTRAP_RETRY_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`.

**Tertiary fix (v1.6): InboundIdleTimeout state machine event.** Added `Event.InboundIdleTimeout(sinceLastInboundMs)` to `RestStateMachine`. `KtorRelayTransport.startIdleWatchdog` emits `InboundStalledEvent` once per session when `sinceLastInbound >= INBOUND_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS = 60_000L`. `HybridRelayTransport` collector forwards it → state machine transitions `WsActive → RestActive` with reason `inbound_idle_timeout` → REST poll picks up envelopes from `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store`. Catches the half-dead-WS case where TCP stays open but the relay is no longer pushing frames to this socket.

**Init race fix (v1.2): Mutex around `initMessagingFromStorage`.** `MainActivity.LaunchedEffect` + `PhantomMessagingService.onStartCommand` could both call the init concurrently, both pass the `if (messagingService != null) return` gate before either wrote, both construct a `DefaultMessagingService`, both call `startReceiving`. Result: duplicate `transport.incoming` subscriptions and double `MEDIA_RX` / `RECV_DIAG envelope_seen` lines. The Mutex closes the race; the second caller waits, observes a populated `messagingService`, and short-circuits.

**Diagnostic logs (kept in production):** `RECV_DIAG` events across the receive pipeline (service lifecycle, container init, transport.incoming subscription, envelope_seen) under tag `PhantomMessaging`. Useful for future regression triage; no production cost beyond `Log.i` overhead.

**Reverted v1.3 + v1.4 + v1.5 regressions in v1.6:** my earlier diagnostic A/B disabling of OkHttp WS `pingInterval(0)` + `readTimeout(0L)` was an own-goal. With WS heartbeat disabled the socket stayed "alive" by TCP standards even when half-dead → `WsSessionEnded` never fired → `activeOutboundFailureCount` never accumulated → REST auto-fallback never activated. Returned to production defaults `pingInterval(15s)` + `readTimeout(60s)`. This is now a hard rule (memory entry written).

**Test #86 verdict (Vladislav Tecno real device, after `pm clear phantom.android`):**

```
TransportManager: ordered=[Direct, Reality, Tor]
TransportManager: probe_returned kind=Direct ok=true
TransportManager: chain_attempt_success kind=Direct socksPort=null
PhantomRelay: WebSocket connected successfully  (wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws)
PhantomMessaging: Decrypt OK
PhantomMessaging: DB insertMessage OK
PhantomMessaging: handleDeliver DONE
```

Direct works on Tecno Wi-Fi. Messages emu → Tecno flow through the full pipeline to UI.

**Pre-merge audit (per Vladislav explicit lock on the English-only rule in code/branches/PR descriptions):** branch name, all 8 commit subjects and bodies, full diff of all 12 changed files — clean of Russian. PR body had Russian (drafted in chat language), rewritten in English before merge.

**Known follow-ups recorded in `Open follow-ups`:**
- **MAC error session repair** — Test #86 happened only after `pm clear` because force-stop cycles had corrupted Double Ratchet local state. `Permanent decrypt failure (MAC error)` → `ack_deliver_send` → silent message loss. Architect-designed 4-step plan queued for next session: stop ack-deliver on MAC error (debug/beta), add DECRYPT_TRACE diagnostic logs (msg id, sender, conversation, session state, x3dhInit presence, error type, action), add session repair path (mark suspect, optional local ratchet reset, force fresh X3DH on next outgoing), add a "repair without wipe" capability. Mini-lock to be authored at session start.
- **Network change detection** — Wi-Fi swap mid-session doesn't trigger a fresh chain walk; out of scope of #234.
- **WS+REST duplicate envelopes** — during `WsActive ↔ RestActive` transitions the same envelope may arrive on both channels. The idempotent ledger (H2b PR #129) catches duplicates correctly, but the architectural cleanup is deferred.

**Key lessons recorded as memory entries** (read by every future session):
1. **Sticky fallback hint = primary lock-in.** Saving `lastWorkingTransport` on ANY success makes the first-successful-fallback de-facto primary for the TTL window. Only save when `kind == strategy.chain.first()`.
2. **Never disable WS heartbeat as a "diagnostic A/B".** OkHttp WS Ping is the trigger that makes `WsSessionEnded` fire, which is the trigger that makes the existing auto-fallback path work. Disabling it breaks recovery.
3. **Logcat tag coverage matters.** `TransportManager` logs go under tag `TransportManager`, not `PhantomTransport`. Diagnostic filters that miss the actual tag will produce false "code didn't run" verdicts. Full transport-related logcat command must include `PhantomMessaging:V PhantomTransport:V PhantomHybrid:V PhantomRelay:V TransportManager:V`.
4. **Don't blindly follow an architect's plan — read the code first.** Vladislav called out v1.5 where I shipped `APP_LEVEL_PING_ENABLED=true` claiming it added app-level Ping; grep showed it was a documentation-only constant with zero call sites. Architect summaries describe intent, not necessarily what the code does. Verify with grep + code read before pushing.
5. **Force-stop cycles can corrupt Double Ratchet local state** to the point where the only working fix is `pm clear`. This is a known crypto-layer hazard that needs the session-repair PR queued above.

**Stabilization Sprint queue updated.** PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1 (queue item #3, mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-new-msg-chip.md`) on HOLD on `feat/pr-ui-chat-new-msg-chip1` branch — not regressed by this PR, but should resume only after CRYPTO-SESSION-REPAIR1 (new queue item, inserted before CHIP1 due to crypto-layer severity).

**CI:** 3/3 green (Android `build-and-test`, Relay `build-test`, Relay `lint`). 171/171 transport unit tests pass. APK MD5 `d3b7880dc37516ce49330fceda574316` from the last debug build matched the device that Test #86 verified.

### 2026-05-26 (tue, very late) · PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-CACHE1 MERGED — chat-list lifecycle FINALLY PASS

PR #231 `d933b0b6` merged after Test #82.1 PASS on Tecno real device. **First chat-list lifecycle track to PASS** after three architectural PARKs (#217 AUTOSCROLL1, #226 BOTTOM-ANCHOR1, #228 THREAD-STATE1). The Variant C escalation worked: hot `ChatThreadStateHolder` (in-memory `StateFlow<List<MessageEntity>>` cache per conversation) + ChatList row-tap preload + ChatScreen snapshot-seed pattern eliminates the cold-Flow first-emit gap that defeated #228.

**v1 (commit `3ae54bb3`) data-lifecycle landed:**
- `ChatThreadStateHolder` (shared/core/messaging) with LRU 8, observer/preload jobs on `appScope`.
- `MessageRepository.observeMessages` + SqlDelight impl cherry-picked from the parked `feat/pr-ui-chat-thread-state1` branch.
- ChatListScreen row-tap + AddContact onAdded → fire-and-forget `holder.preload(conversationId)` immediately before navigation (Vladislav-locked: NON-SUSPEND on purpose — suspend-await would produce a visible micro-pause).
- ChatScreen `remember(conversationId) { holder.snapshot(...) }` + `holder.observe(...).collectAsState(initial = initialSnapshot)`. Anti-pattern `collectAsState(initial = emptyList())` (the #228 root cause) banned.
- 9 holder unit tests in shared/core/messaging, all pass on `jvmTest`.
- 8 `CHAT_CACHE` logs (preload_start/done, snapshot_hit/miss, observe_start, emit source=db, evict reason=lru|manual, clear).

**Test #82 verdict (v1 partial pass):** data lifecycle PASS — `preload_done count=N ms=<n>` + `snapshot_hit count=N` BEFORE `ChatScreen subscribed` verified on Tecno. But opening position FAIL — chat opens with data but not on newest messages (LazyColumn still oldest-first, source[0] = oldest). Vladislav-architect verdict: in-track v1.1 fix, NOT a 4th data-lifecycle variant.

**v1.1 (commit `3b334635`) bottom-anchor landed:**
- `displayItems = chatItems.asReversed()` (newest-first source order).
- `LazyColumn(reverseLayout = true)`: source[0] = `__bottom_anchor__` 8dp Spacer (visual bottom), source[1] = newest message, source[last] = `__e2ee__` E2EENoteRow (visual top).
- `listState = remember(conversationId) { LazyListState(0, 0) }` — every chat-open starts fresh at visual bottom (source index 0) without a delayed `scrollToItem`.
- Pinned banner moved OUTSIDE LazyColumn into a Column wrap so it does not participate in reverseLayout source ordering.
- New `CHAT_LIST open_state` log: `reverseLayout=true total=<N+2> firstVisible=<i> firstOffset=<px> sourceFirst=__bottom_anchor__ sourceLast=__e2ee__`.
- Carried forward from CACHE1 v1 scope; cherry-picked from #228 branch but rewired around the holder rather than a cold Flow.

**Test #82.1 verdict (v1.1 PASS):** Tecno log shows `preload_done count=46 ms=27` → `snapshot_hit count=46` → `ChatScreen subscribed` → `open_state reverseLayout=true total=50 firstVisible=0`. Visual verdict from Vladislav: "Ура, вроде работает. Открывается сразу вниз, всё ок." Side notes (NOT blockers for this PR):
- Manual scroll through history still slightly jerky → `PR-UI-CHAT-RENDER-PERF1` (queue item #2, now CONDITIONAL).
- No in-chat "↓ new messages" indicator when user is scrolled up and incoming arrives → `PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1` (queue item #3, design handoff provided by Vladislav, next track).

**Anti-pattern signatures verified absent from the merged diff:** `collectAsState(initial = emptyList())`, `var messages by remember`, `LaunchedEffect + scrollToItem`, `snapshotFlow.first { > 0 }`, `withFrameNanos + scrollToItem`, `initialMessagesLoaded` placeholder gate, large bottom spacer >16dp.

**Stabilization Sprint queue advances.** Item #1 (CACHE1) ✅ DONE. Item #2 (RENDER-PERF1) was conditional and is NOT currently being escalated — CACHE1 alone closed the data lifecycle. Item #3 (NEW-MSG-CHIP1) is next, with a Vladislav-designer handoff bundle providing full 1:1 spec (button geometry, badge tokens, animation curves, tap behaviour). Mini-lock authored as `docs/tracks/chat-new-msg-chip.md`.

**Vladislav explicit lock 2026-05-26:** "только этот дизайнерский вариант должен быть 1 в 1 с анимацией" — implementation MUST be pixel-perfect / animation-perfect against the handoff. Mini-lock encodes this as a banned-deviation constraint with token tables for geometry / typography / colours / durations / easing curves.

### 2026-05-26 (tue, late) · Android Stabilization Sprint mode ENGAGED + 5-PR queue locked

Vladislav explicit decision after three chat-list lifecycle FAILs in the same week (AUTOSCROLL1 + BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 + THREAD-STATE1). New operating mode: **feature freeze on Android core**, only stabilization work in a locked 5-PR queue, no new feature proposals until the queue exits with verified PASS on Tecno real device.

**Out for the duration of the sprint** (Vladislav-explicit):
- iOS port (still beta-tier per 2026-05-14 strategy lock).
- Calls feature expansion (C-track stays in `Open follow-ups` but is not active).
- Groups beyond current Alpha-0 scope (no channels, no broadcast, no admin UI).
- New transports beyond WSS + REALITY + Tor + REST.
- Attachments, username directory, file send.
- "While we're here" cleanups outside the active queue item.

**Locked queue:**
1. PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-CACHE1 (next to start) — hot `StateFlow` holder; eliminates the 0.8–1.3 s chat-open black wait. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-thread-cache.md`. Cherry-picks the salvageable artefacts from the closed `feat/pr-ui-chat-thread-state1` branch (observeMessages, bottom-anchor render, side-effect defer, animation suppression, test fakes).
2. PR-UI-CHAT-RENDER-PERF1 (CONDITIONAL) — only if CACHE1 ships with verified `CHAT_CACHE snapshot_hit count=N` log BEFORE first Compose frame AND Test #82 still shows >50 ms black wait. Then bottleneck is render cost (MessageBubble / AnimatedVisibility / Canvas / reverseLayout re-measure), NOT a 4th architectural data-lifecycle variant. Vladislav-locked escalation path.
3. PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1 — floating "↓ N new messages" chip when user is scrolled up and incoming arrives. Side-issue surfaced during Test #81.1 — deferred until base chat list is stable.
4. PR-NOTIF-POLICY1 — conversation-level notification with InboxStyle + unread count + clear-on-chat-open. Closes the "уведомления исчезают" finding from PR-NOTIF-DIAG #213 (one `notificationId = conversationId.hashCode()` caused notification replacement). Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/notif-policy.md`.
5. PR-D1e first-message bootstrap — close the 10–20 s delay + yellow-dot after Add Contact (prekey_fetch timeout pattern from `project_open_followups_2026_05_17.md`).

**Sprint exit criterion.** All 5 queue items must PASS on Tecno real device:
- CACHE1: chat opens within one Compose frame on ChatList tap, no black wait.
- RENDER-PERF1: either not needed (CACHE1 alone sufficient) OR ships with smooth-scroll verdict.
- NEW-MSG-CHIP1: chip appears when scrolled up + incoming arrives, tap → jump-to-bottom works.
- NOTIF-POLICY1: notifications no longer overwrite; conversation-level grouping verified.
- D1e: first message after Add Contact arrives within 5 s on a healthy network.

At that point we re-open feature roadmap discussion. Until then: queue only.

**Direct Vladislav quotes 2026-05-26:**
- "Feature freeze на Android core. Никаких новых крупных фич: calls, groups, iOS, new transports. Только стабилизация."
- "Пока базовый ChatScreen открывается плохо, любые новые UX-слои будут стоять на нестабильной основе."
- "Не надо начинать сразу NEW-MSG-CHIP, NOTIF-POLICY, D1e или iOS. Сначала: CACHE1."

**Funding-track / external work** (README polish, funding.json updates, well-known) is allowed out-of-queue but only on explicit per-PR Vladislav greenlight — it's orthogonal to Android stabilization and doesn't burn Android-PR budget.

**Memory entry hardened:** `feedback_android_stabilization_sprint.md` — top-pinned in `MEMORY.md` index (triple-🔥). To be read FIRST before proposing any new feature work on Android until the queue exit criterion is met.

### 2026-05-26 (tue) · PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1 PARKED — replaced by PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-CACHE1 (Variant C escalation)

PR #228 closed without merge per `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` rule 4 — two implementation attempts (v1 `e2700f82`, v1.1 `c0fab2b4`) both FAIL on Test #81 / #81.1 on Tecno real device. The Flow-backed migration was architecturally correct (`MessageRepository.observeMessages` → `SqlDelightMessageRepository.observeMessages` via `asFlow().mapToList(Dispatchers.IO)`; ChatScreen `collectAsState(initial = emptyList())` wrap with `remember(conversationId)`; all 9 reloadMessages call-sites walked + classified Type A/B/C; reloadMessages helper deleted; LazyColumn `reverseLayout = true` + `__bottom_anchor__` 8dp spacer + `asReversed()`; `initialMessageIds` snapshot for animation suppression; v1.1 added `firstFlowEmitReceived` defer for markConversationRead + profile-card-send via a separate `LaunchedEffect`). CI green. Anti-pattern grep clean. Side-effect order correct in v1.1 — `SEND_TRACE` ran AFTER `observe_emit`.

**But** the SqlDelight cold-Flow first emission itself takes **0.8–1.3 s on Tecno with 30+ messages**, and that IS the black wait Vladislav reports. Tecno log from Test #81.1:

```
23:48:20.495  ChatScreen subscribed
23:48:20.517  CHAT_THREAD observe_started        (+22 ms)
23:48:21.858  CHAT_THREAD observe_emit count=34  (+1.341 s)   ← black wait window

23:48:44.659  …observe_started +26 ms …observe_emit cnt=37 +1.054 s
23:50:43.794  …observe_started +21 ms …observe_emit cnt=38 +0.810 s
```

`collectAsState(initial = emptyList())` means ChatScreen renders the empty list first; `LazyColumn(reverseLayout = true)` anchors to that empty state until Flow emits. No amount of `LaunchedEffect` ordering inside Compose can fix this — Compose has already painted the empty frame by the time effects run.

**Architectural decision (Vladislav-architect 2026-05-26, Variant C escalation).** Replace cold-Flow + empty-initial with a hot `StateFlow<List<MessageEntity>>` held by an AppContainer-scoped `ChatThreadStateHolder`. ChatScreen reads `holder.snapshot(conversationId)` synchronously as the initial value (already populated by ChatList row tap → `holder.preload(conversationId)` BEFORE navigation). The cold `observeMessages` Flow from PR #228 carries forward as the wire feeding the holder's StateFlow on DB changes — none of the storage-layer work is wasted.

**Rule 4 fires for the THIRD time on chat-list lifecycle:**
- PR #217 PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 — 2 attempts, FAIL (scrollToItem timing).
- PR #226 PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 — 3 attempts, FAIL (LazyColumn layer alone).
- PR #228 PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1 — 2 attempts, FAIL (cold Flow + empty initial).

→ Variant C escalation locked. Three is the limit. NO fourth architectural shot at this lifecycle without explicit Vladislav approval.

**Salvageable artefacts from `feat/pr-ui-chat-thread-state1`** (referenced by THREAD-CACHE1, branch kept for cherry-pick):
- `MessageRepository.observeMessages(conversationId): Flow<List<MessageEntity>>` interface method.
- `SqlDelightMessageRepository.observeMessages` implementation.
- `LazyColumn(reverseLayout = true)` + bottom anchor spacer + `asReversed()` rendering.
- `firstFlowEmitReceived` + deferred side-effects pattern.
- `initialMessageIds` animation suppression snapshot.
- Test-fake updates for the new interface method.

**Replacement track:** `PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-CACHE1`. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-thread-cache.md` with the architect's 6 questions answered (location: AppContainer singleton in `shared/core/messaging`; API: `observe / snapshot / preload / evict / clear`; preload sites: ChatList tap + incoming-message + notification tap; cache policy: LRU 8 conversations; zero DB/schema changes; minimum first-PR scope). Out-of-scope: floating "↓ N new messages" chip (separate PR-UI-CHAT-NEW-MSG-CHIP1 after CACHE1 lands), scroll-perf, group chat, multi-account.

**Side-issue surfaced by Vladislav during Test #81.1:** when user scrolls up to read history and an incoming arrives, no auto-scroll (correct UX, Vladislav-locked 2026-05-25), but no "↓ new messages" indicator either. Track as separate PR after CACHE1.

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** `feedback_chat_list_lifecycle_three_fails.md` — supersedes the two previous chat-list memories (`scroll_to_bottom_not_chat_ux`, `chatscreen_pull_style_root_cause`) as primary guidance. Durable rule: ChatScreen MUST render against a hot StateFlow whose `.value` is pre-populated, NOT cold Flow + emptyList initial.

### 2026-05-25 (mon) · PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 PARKED — replaced by PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1

PR #226 closed without merge per `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` rule 4 — three implementation attempts (v1 `14307829`, v1.1 `4ae6f8ba`, v1.2 `813484dc`) all FAIL on Test #80 / #80.1 / #80.2. The `reverseLayout = true` direction was architecturally not wrong — it correctly bottom-anchored the LazyColumn item order. But it could not solve the underlying root cause: **`ChatScreen` opens with empty local `messages` state and only loads history AFTER first compose**. Compose anchors LazyColumn's `firstVisibleItemIndex` to the empty-or-e2ee-only state on frame 1; when messages stream in later, the anchor either refuses to follow (mid-history opening) OR Compose animates all history items as if newly arrived (slide-in pile-up). No amount of LazyColumn-layer tweaks fixes this.

**What each attempt proved:**

- **v1** (`scrollToItem(0)` after Flow-less reload via `LaunchedEffect(conversationId)`) — `total=1 sourceFirst=empty` log on first render, opens not at bottom.
- **v1.1** (added `initialMessagesLoaded` gate + 72dp spacer) — replaced "mid-history flash" with "black wait then jump"; 72dp spacer left a visible blank under newest bubble.
- **v1.2** (removed black gate, shrunk spacer to 8dp, kept `initialMessageIds` only for animation suppression) — log-side bug closed (`total=1` gone), spacer no longer over-correcting, but black wait persisted because the first Compose frame still saw `messages = emptyList()` for ~1 frame and then animated all 23+ messages in as "new" via the `AnimatedVisibility` wrapper.

**Architectural decision (Vladislav-architect 2026-05-25, Variant A+).** Replace pull-style local `messages` state with Flow-backed reactive source from the database, combined with bottom-anchored render in the same PR. Reasoning:

- Variant A (Flow only) — solves data-source but doesn't guarantee bottom-anchor placement.
- Variant B (initialMessages pre-load via navigation) — partial fix, requires navigation-path changes for every chat-entry route (including notification tap), doesn't make ChatScreen reactive, leaves manual `reloadMessages()` everywhere.
- Variant C (`ChatThreadStateHolder` ViewModel cache) — best long-term but too big for this PR (cache invalidation, eviction policy, DI wiring, lifecycle).
- **A+ wins** because: (a) `sqldelight-coroutines-extensions` is already in `shared/core/storage/build.gradle.kts:19`, infrastructure free; (b) `observeMessages` replaces 12 manual `reloadMessages()` call-sites with a declarative subscription; (c) combined with the bottom-anchor approach PR #226 v1.2 already validated structurally, the Flow first-emission timing aligns with LazyColumn's first compose pass — no anchor-to-empty-state race.

**Audit findings supporting A+ (captured for builder reference):**

- `MessageRepository.getMessages(conversationId)` is `suspend fun List<MessageEntity>` (pull-style, snapshot).
- SQLDelight `Query<T>.asFlow()` extension available via `app.cash.sqldelight:coroutines-extensions` — dependency already in `gradle/libs.versions.toml:106` + `shared/core/storage/build.gradle.kts:19`. **Zero usages** of `.asFlow()` in the codebase as of master `024d7c2f` — infrastructure waiting to be picked up.
- `ChatScreen.kt:123` `var messages by remember { mutableStateOf(emptyList()) }` + 12 manual `reloadMessages()` call-sites (lines 399, 417, 516, 1013, 1031, 1234, 1245, 1291 + others). Most are Type A (pure list refresh, deletable with Flow) with a few Type B (carry separate side-effects like `markConversationRead`, `sendProfileCard`).
- `ChatListScreen.kt:101-102` uses the same pull pattern. It's NOT migrated by this PR (out of scope) — pull-style there isn't currently broken.
- `DefaultMessagingService._incomingMessages: MutableSharedFlow<IncomingMessage>` exists and is already wired into ChatListScreen as a refresh trigger; ChatScreen will stop needing it once messages flow from the DB directly.
- `MainActivity.kt:457` `Screen.Chat(conversationId, theirUsername)` — navigation carries only IDs, no pre-loaded messages.

**Replacement track:** `PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1`. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-thread-state.md`. Scope: `MessageRepository.observeMessages()` Flow source + ChatScreen `collectAsState` + bottom-anchored render (carried forward from PR #226 v1.2 structural lessons, NOT scroll-to-bottom-after-load) + initial-history animation suppression + walk-through of 12 `reloadMessages()` call-sites with Type A / B / C classification. Vladislav-locked 8 acceptance scenarios. Mandatory pre-implementation checklist (item-order mapping + side-effect inventory + anti-pattern verification) included in the mini-lock.

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** `feedback_chatscreen_pull_style_root_cause.md` — for chat UIs, both `scrollToItem`-after-load AND `reverseLayout`-without-Flow are symptom-level fixes; the real root cause is empty local state at first compose. Until the data source is reactive (`Flow<List<…>>` via `collectAsState`), no LazyColumn-layer tweak can produce messenger UX. Lesson references the THREE failed attempts on PR #226 so future sessions immediately recognise the anti-pattern.

**Discipline checkpoint.** WORKING_RULES rule 4 fired for the SECOND time in operation (first was AUTOSCROLL1 → BOTTOM-ANCHOR1; now BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 → THREAD-STATE1). Rule is load-bearing twice over. Both parks happened after explicit architect verdict, not after speculative "maybe we should try another approach" hand-wave. Builder explicitly did NOT attempt a v1.3 inside PR #226 even though 1-2 more local tweaks (zero-height anchor, different `mapToList` dispatcher, etc) felt reachable — that restraint is the rule in action.

**Queue change.** Row 4 of consolidated queue: PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1 → **PR-UI-CHAT-THREAD-STATE1** (same slot, replacement track). Rows 5–10 unchanged.

**Out-of-scope items deferred (still):** "↓ N new messages" floating chip, preserve-scroll-position when reading history, `NotificationManager.cancel` on chat open, ChatListScreen Flow migration, `MessageBubble` rendering optimization, scroll-performance work. Each has its own track or deferral note.

### 2026-05-24 (sun, late night) · PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 PARKED — replaced by PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1

PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 was parked after Test #79 / #79.1.1. Both attempts proved that post-load `scrollToItem` is not acceptable messenger UX:

- First attempt (PR #217 v1, `14c7f2aa`) used `messages.lastIndex` and missed real LazyColumn indices because the LazyColumn contains an E2EE prefix row + optional pinned banner + day separators on top of the messages. On a 34-message multi-day chat, `messages.lastIndex` was 33 but the real LazyColumn last index was ~39 — `scrollToItem(33)` landed 6 rows above the bottom.
- Second attempt (PR #217 v1.1, `3d15615a`) used `listState.layoutInfo.totalItemsCount - 1` (correct index) gated by `snapshotFlow + first { it > 0 }` to wait for layout, but still produced a 1.8–2.3 second delayed jump — user saw black wait / mid-history flash before the chat snapped to the bottom. Architectural, not bandaid-fixable.

**Decision:** replace autoscroll-after-load with bottom-anchored chat list architecture. Mainstream chat apps (Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal) don't scroll-to-bottom; they use `LazyColumn(reverseLayout = true)` with reversed item order so the natural rendering position is already at the latest message. Initial open requires zero scroll logic.

**PR #217 closed without merge** per `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` rule 4 (two architectural attempts on the same track → park and redesign). Commits stay closed-but-visible on GitHub (`14c7f2aa` + `3d15615a`) for diagnostic trail. Local + remote `feat/pr-ui-chat-autoscroll1` branch deleted.

**Replacement track: PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1.** Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-bottom-anchor.md` (authored same session). Scope: LazyColumn `reverseLayout = true` + reversed item order, E2EE row + pinned banner repositioning, date separators re-derived for reverseLayout, scroll-to-pinned recomputed, all AUTOSCROLL1 plumbing (`LaunchedEffect + scrollToItem + snapshotFlow + withFrameNanos` chain) DELETED not migrated. Mini-lock requires builder to write down chosen item-order mapping BEFORE implementation (which collection is oldest-first, which is newest-first, `reverseLayout` true/false, which item appears at visual bottom) to avoid reversed-date-separator class bugs.

**Out-of-scope (deferred again):** "↓ N new messages" floating chip, preserve-scroll-position when reading history, `NotificationManager.cancel` on chat open (PR-NOTIF-POLICY1), pagination / history loading. "↓ N new messages" chip explicitly OUT of first PR to keep scope tight per Vladislav 2026-05-24.

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** `feedback_scroll_to_bottom_not_chat_ux.md` — for chat UIs, delayed `scrollToItem` after loading is NOT equivalent to bottom anchoring. If the user can see mid-history / black wait / delayed jump, the architecture is wrong, not the index math. Use `reverseLayout = true` from the start.

**Discipline checkpoint.** First time WORKING_RULES rule 4 actually fired in real operation (two architectural attempts → park, not third attempt). The rule is load-bearing, not theatre.

**Queue change.** Row 4 of consolidated queue: PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 → **PR-UI-CHAT-BOTTOM-ANCHOR1** (same slot, replacement track). Rows 5–10 unchanged.

### 2026-05-24 (sun, night) · Out-of-queue: FLOSS/fund hybrid verification — well-known proof + schema bump v1.1.0 + webpage URLs to phntm.pro

PR #223 merged + deployed + Cloudflare-purged end-to-end. **FLOSS/fund verification badges went green** per Vladislav verdict ("Да, все ок"). This is the third and final iteration on the FLOSS/fund submission today; the funding-track block of the day closes here.

**Cause.** Even with the type-`other` fix from PR #221, FLOSS/fund directory page showed the manifest as "verified at submission time" but with red badges next to `webpage` and `repository` — those URLs are only auto-verifiable if either (a) the URL hostname matches the manifest URL hostname, or (b) there's a well-known proof file at the URL endpoint pointing back at the manifest. PHANTOM's master at the start of the day had `webpageUrl.url = https://github.com/.../Phantom` (which can't be auto-verified because the manifest is hosted on `phntm.pro`, not `github.com`) and no `wellKnown` field on `repositoryUrl`.

**Hybrid fix (Vladislav-designed, simplest minimal-files approach):**
1. Point both `webpageUrl` fields at `https://phntm.pro` — hostname now matches the manifest URL hostname → auto-verified, zero extra files needed.
2. Keep `repositoryUrl.url = https://github.com/...` (real source code IS on GitHub) but add `wellKnown` sub-field pointing at a new well-known proof file in the repo.
3. New `.well-known/funding-manifest-urls` file in the repo root, one line `https://phntm.pro/funding.json` + UNIX trailing LF. Reachable via GitHub raw/blob.

**PR #223 (master `247e3924`).** Two files: `funding.json` (5 semantic changes + pretty-print of `plans.channels` arrays from source) and `.well-known/funding-manifest-urls` (new, 31 bytes). CRLF preserved for `funding.json`, LF preserved for `.well-known/funding-manifest-urls` (`git ls-files --eol` confirmed `i/lf w/lf` — no autocrlf conversion). Side-effect: schema bumped to v1.1.0 with `$schema` URL `https://fundingjson.org/schema/v1.1.0.json` added at the top.

**Deploy on VPS.** Same canonical one-liner used since PR #221: `git pull && docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy`. Plus Cloudflare cache purge (Custom Purge → `https://phntm.pro/funding.json`) because we'd set `Cache-Control: max-age=3600` and the previous PR #221 content might have been edge-cached. Cloudflare `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` on the post-purge fetch confirmed origin was tapped.

**Live verified (this entry's curl):**
- HTTP 200, Content-Length 6688 (was 6482; +206 = `$schema` URL + `wellKnown` URL + webpage URL changes + pretty-print expansion).
- `$schema` = `https://fundingjson.org/schema/v1.1.0.json`.
- `version` = `v1.1.0`.
- Both webpageUrl values = `https://phntm.pro`.
- `repositoryUrl.wellKnown` present and points at the GitHub blob URL.
- 5 occurrences of `phntm.pro` in JSON (2 webpage + 2 email + 1 plan description mentioning domain registration).
- Well-known file on GitHub raw: HTTP 200, 31 bytes, hex ends with `0a` (LF), content `https://phntm.pro/funding.json\n`.
- FLOSS/fund badges green per Vladislav.

**Funding-track day total:** 9 PRs merged (#215 → #216 → #218 → #219 → #220 → #221 → #222 → #223 → this close-PR), 3 VPS deploys, 4 memory entries hardened (Wyoming, single-file bind-mount, FLOSS/fund crypto=other, FLOSS/fund hybrid verification). All FLOSS/fund verification problems closed.

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** `feedback_floss_fund_hybrid_verification.md` — the hybrid verification pattern (own-domain hostname for `webpageUrl` + well-known proof file for `repositoryUrl`) is the cheapest way to get all-green FLOSS/fund badges when the project's webpage is on a domain you control AND the repository is on GitHub. Don't try to verify GitHub-hosted webpage URLs by adding well-known there (GitHub raw plain-text files work, but it's two well-known files instead of one).

### 2026-05-24 (sun, very late) · Out-of-queue: FLOSS/fund schema hotfix — crypto type 'cryptocurrency' → 'other'

PR #221 merged + deployed end-to-end during the same session. Out-of-queue continuation of the funding track.

**Cause.** FLOSS/fund submission flow rejected `funding.json` on the `type` field of the three crypto channels (`bitcoin`, `monero`, `ethereum`). The schema they validate against does NOT include `cryptocurrency` as a permitted enum value; the closest legal value is `other`. Source: Vladislav's locally-corrected `D:\VL Stories Studio\funding.json` brought back from the failed submission.

**Diagnosis.** Compared the locally-corrected source with `master/funding.json` byte-level + structurally. **Only 3 fields changed** — all `type: cryptocurrency` → `type: other` for the three crypto channels. Wallet addresses, descriptions, plans, entity, projects — all unchanged. Size diff: -27 bytes (3 × 9 byte saving from `cryptocurrency` → `other`). Source file was LF-only; CRLF preserved in master via byte-level Python `replace` instead of file copy.

**PR #221 (master `a938ce6d`).** Exactly 3-line diff. CRLF preserved. JSON re-validated.

**Deploy on VPS.** Same one-liner used since the `--force-recreate` lesson:
```
cd /home/phantom/Phantom && git pull origin master && \
  docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --force-recreate caddy
```
`Container phantom-caddy Started` (not `Running`), confirming the container was recreated and picked up the new file inode.

**Verified live.** `curl -s https://phntm.pro/funding.json | python -c '...'` confirms all six channel types as expected: liberapay/buy-me-a-coffee `payment-provider`, bitcoin/monero/ethereum **`other`**, bank-wire `bank`. JSON valid. `grep -c '"cryptocurrency"' = 0`, `grep -c '"other"' = 3`. Content-Length 6347 (LF on VPS via git autocrlf=input behaviour — does not affect JSON parsing or download size for crawlers).

**FLOSS/fund unblocked again.** Vladislav can re-submit the manifest URL.

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** `feedback_floss_fund_schema_other.md` — fundingjson.org / FLOSS-fund schema enum for `funding.channels[].type` does NOT include `cryptocurrency` (the obvious value). For crypto channels use `other` (or another permitted enum value if the spec evolves). When adding a new channel type to `funding.json`, look up the current spec first; don't guess from the friendly name.

**Source-of-truth follow-up (Vladislav-side, NOT in this PR):** the local `D:\VL Stories Studio\funding.json` now matches master (Vladislav already corrected it locally before re-submitting). Cloudflare placeholder issue from PR #219 is also still resolved in master. The local file is the canonical "next edit starts here" copy; future edits should start from a fresh `git pull` of the repo version to keep them in sync.

### 2026-05-24 (sun, late) · Out-of-queue: serve funding.json on phntm.pro + email-placeholder hotfix

Two related PRs merged + deployed end-to-end during the same session. Out-of-queue (FLOSS/fund unblock continuation from PR #215).

**PR #218 (master `14236dd0`) — Caddy route + bind-mount.** Added explicit `handle /funding.json` block on the `phntm.pro` vhost (placed before `/terms`/`/privacy`/catch-all so it matches first) plus a single-file bind-mount of the repo-root `funding.json` into the caddy container at `/srv/funding/funding.json`. Headers per `fundingjson.org` spec: `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`. Single source of truth at repo root — no duplicate copies in `deploy/landing/` that would silently drift.

Deploy on VPS (Vladislav-side, found prod repo via `docker compose ls` → `/home/phantom/Phantom`):
```
cd /home/phantom/Phantom && git pull origin master && \
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d caddy
```
Only caddy recreated; relay / tor / ntfy / xray / webtunnel-bridge untouched. `curl -I https://phntm.pro/funding.json` returned `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`, `Content-Length: 6378`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600`, `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`. End-to-end JSON validate passed.

**PR #219 (master `073bc70f`) — email-placeholder hotfix.** PR #215's `funding.json` landed with literal `[email protected]` strings in two places (`entity.email` and `bank-wire.address`). Initially suspected Anthropic PII redaction in my tool I/O, but byte-level dump (`python` + `open('rb')`) showed `funding.json` physically contained the 17-character ASCII string `[email protected]` at the relevant offsets (hex `5b656d61696c2070726f7465637465645d`). Root cause: the source `D:\VL Stories Studio\funding.json` that seeded PR #215 was copy-pasted from HTML where Cloudflare's email-protection feature wrapped the original address in a JavaScript decoder tag. Copy-as-plain-text strips the decoder and leaves the placeholder.

Fix: byte-level `replace` via Python (Edit tool failed because Anthropic's PII filter masks `<localpart>@phntm.pro` strings in my tool inputs as identical to `[email protected]`, so `old_string != new_string` check failed). CRLF line endings preserved — exact 2-line diff. JSON re-parsed OK.

Deploy on VPS — first attempt with `docker compose up -d caddy` showed `STATUS: Up 19 minutes` (NOT recreated). Caddy continued to serve the old funding.json. Root cause: **single-file Docker bind-mount + `git pull`**. `git pull` updates the host file via `mv`, which creates a NEW inode at the same path. The container's mount-point still points to the OLD inode (now unlinked from the path). `docker compose up -d` without `--force-recreate` does NOT recreate the container if compose.yaml is unchanged — it just checks the config diff. So the container's mount stays bound to the old inode forever, until explicitly recreated.

Second attempt: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy`. New container, new inode mapping. `curl https://phntm.pro/funding.json` then confirmed: `Content-Length: 6374` (was 6378; difference is exactly 2 × (17-15) bytes), `entity.email` length 15, `bank-wire.address` length 77, zero literal `[email protected]` substrings, 3 "legal" matches (2 email + 1 plan guid/name).

**Lesson hardened in agent memory:** any future `git pull` on the VPS that updates `funding.json` or any other single-file bind-mounted asset MUST be followed by `--force-recreate` on the affected service, NOT just `up -d`. Captured as `feedback_single_file_bind_mount_recreate.md`.

**Source-of-truth follow-up (Vladislav-side, NOT in this PR):** the local copy at `D:\VL Stories Studio\funding.json` that seeded PR #215 still contains the same Cloudflare placeholders. Vladislav to copy the post-PR-#219 master `funding.json` back over the local file so the next manual edit doesn't reintroduce the bug.

**Open follow-up generated during this session: row 10 in consolidated queue — PR-UI-SUPPORT-SCREEN.** Vladislav 2026-05-24: "нам еще в дальнейшем надо будет добавить возможность поддержки нас (то есть указать ссылки на все эти сервисы Buy Me A Coffee и другие варианты включая криптокошельки. но это потом". Working sketch (not a mini-lock yet — Vladislav said "потом"): new section in Settings → "Support PHANTOM" with cards per channel — Liberapay + Buy Me a Coffee as deep-links opening in browser; BTC/XMR/ETH as copy-to-clipboard + QR. Source of truth = `funding.json` (either hard-coded mirror in Android resources, or fetched from `https://phntm.pro/funding.json` at runtime). Optional short "why we accept these channels" rationale per channel for transparency. Foundation in place after today: funding.json in repo (PR #215) + on the domain (PR #218 + #219).

### 2026-05-24 (sun) · Out-of-queue: funding.json + README Funding section

Closed PR #215 (`feat/funding-json-update` → master `789c3c9e`). Two commits, two files (`funding.json` + `README.md`). Out-of-queue task per Vladislav, not part of the locked sequence — explicitly inserted to unblock the FLOSS/fund submission flow.

**What landed:**

- **`funding.json` replaced** with the post-pivot canonical version (was the Delaware/NLnet-era manifest from 2026-05). New manifest:
  - `entity.name = Willen LLC`, jurisdiction = Wyoming USA (confirmed by Vladislav 2026-05-24 against Articles of Organization — see memory entry `project_willen_llc_wyoming_2026_05_24.md`).
  - Channels: Liberapay, Buy Me a Coffee, Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, bank wire. Replaces the older GitHub Sponsors / Open Collective / Polar / operator-email set.
  - Plans: iOS port hardware unblock $2 000, external cryptographic audit $15 000, 12-month maintainer runway $60 000, production infrastructure $1 200/yr, legal/compliance baseline $1 500/yr (Wyoming registered agent + annual report + 5472+1120 federal filing + FinCEN BOI).
  - `history: []` (intentionally empty per fundingjson.org spec until first disclosure).
  - Validated: `python -m json.tool funding.json` → Valid JSON.
- **`README.md` Funding section rewrite.** Old `## Funding & sustainability` (philosophy paragraph about commercial managed deployments + priority support + encrypted backup as a sustainability track) was **dropped intentionally** — Vladislav's reasoning: that paragraph contradicts the way PHANTOM is positioned in every active grant application (FLOSS/fund, FUTO, Sovereign Tech all fund non-commercial FOSS, and the commercial-track paragraph created dissonance for grant reviewers). New `## Funding` section is the exact three-line text Vladislav specified: pointer to `funding.json`, list of donation channels (Liberapay, BMAC, BTC/XMR/ETH), and the maintainer/jurisdiction line "PHANTOM is maintained by Willen LLC, a company registered in Wyoming, USA." The previous "Willen LLC (Delaware, USA)" line — which was a historical typo from early-stage docs and never matched reality — is gone for good.
- **License badge already AGPL-3.0-or-later** (no change needed).
- **No NLnet references in README** to remove (already clean in master).

**Verification:** `curl -I https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiudvigVladislav/Phantom/master/funding.json` → `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, `Content-Length: 6378`, `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`, `ETag: "2f05602cdcd74…"`. URL ready to paste into FLOSS/fund submission form.

**Branch protection note.** The original task brief said `git push origin main`. Direct push to the protected `master` branch is blocked by branch protection (would require admin-merge bypass + `--no-verify` skipping hooks, both forbidden by default policy). Landed via standard PR + squash-merge workflow — content-identical result, just respects the protection rules. Future tasks of the same shape should default to `gh pr create + gh pr merge --squash` rather than direct push.

**Discipline note.** The original session ended without a journal entry for PR #215 — Vladislav caught the omission ("ты внес в наш лог и документацию, то, что мы сделали…") and asked explicitly before authorising the next track. This entry is the catch-up. Out-of-queue tasks still need durable fixation per `feedback_durable_log.md` (2026-05-07). Adding a memory entry to harden this for future sessions.

**Locked queue unchanged:**

3. ✅ PR-NOTIF-DIAG
4. 🟢 PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1 — **next**, Vladislav greenlit 2026-05-24 in the same message that flagged the missing journal entry. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-autoscroll.md`.

### 2026-05-23 (sat) · PR-NOTIF-DIAG — incoming-message notification path observability

Closed PR #213 (`feat/pr-notif-diag` → master `a0484602`). One commit, four files (`PhantomNotificationManager.kt` + `PhantomApplication.kt` + `AppContainer.kt` + `DefaultMessagingService.kt`), +295 / −39 lines. Test #78 PASS per architect verdict. Fourth PR end-to-end under `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` (REC3 → PR-DOC-HONESTY → REC-FOLLOWUP → NOTIF-DIAG).

**What landed.** Diagnostic-only PR per mini-lock at `docs/tracks/notifications-diag.md` (merged earlier same day as PR #212). Adds structured `PhantomNotif`-tagged logs at every step from "envelope arrives" to "Android shows heads-up". Zero behaviour change — no new heads-ups, no missed heads-ups, no fix attempts. Modelled on PR-Diag (#143) for the WS transport path.

Specifics:

- `DefaultMessagingService.onNewMessageNotification` signature gained a leading `source: String` parameter (closed enum: `text`, `voice_v1_assembled`, `voice_v1_chunk`, `voice_v2_manifest`). Used for diagnostic attribution only. New private `invokeIncomingNotificationCallback(...)` helper unifies the four invoke call sites under one `runCatching` with `NOTIF invoke_attempt / invoke_ok / invoke_threw` lines. `runCatching` semantics preserved; legacy `Invoking onNewMessageNotification callback (null=…)` text-path line retained for backwards compatibility with older triage habits; legacy `VOICE_RX notification_start/ok` on the legacy voice chunk path also retained alongside.
- `PhantomNotificationManager` got tag `PhantomNotif` and full show-path logging: `show_entry / api_level / permission_check (API 33+) / channel_check / skip reason=… / notify_called / notify_returned`. `createChannel` got attempt/created/skipped lines. `notificationId` logged on every show line (this turned out to be the smoking gun — see Finding below).
- `PhantomApplication.onCreate` now writes one `NOTIF app_snapshot …` line per process start: `permissionGranted=… channelExists=… channelEnabled=… channelImportance=… appNotificationsEnabled=… sdk=…`. Gives every test logcat an immediate snapshot of the device's notification posture.
- `AppContainer` wraps `onNewMessageNotification` callback with `PhantomNotif`-tagged `callback_invoked / callback_returned | callback_threw`. Old `PhantomMessaging`-tagged error log retained.

**Test #78 evidence (Tecno HiOS SDK 31, Wi-Fi, 8 incoming events captured):**

- 7 × `source=text`, 1 × `source=voice_v2_manifest`. All eight events produced the full chain: `NOTIF invoke_attempt → invoke_ok → callback_invoked → show_entry → api_level → channel_check (app_enabled=true channel_enabled=true channel_importance=4) → notify_called → notify_returned → callback_returned`. No `permission_check` line because SDK 31 is pre-Tiramisu (POST_NOTIFICATIONS not runtime). Zero `callback_threw`, zero `invoke_threw`, zero `SecurityException`, zero `AndroidRuntime`.
- The voice path also produced the M1w download chain in parallel (`MEDIA_RX manifest_acked_and_queued → download_progress 1/8 … 8/8 → download_complete → message_ready path=AUDIO_LOCAL`), confirming voice notification + voice download both work end-to-end on Tele2-via-Wi-Fi.
- Startup snapshot: `NOTIF app_snapshot channelExists=true channelEnabled=true channelImportance=4 appNotificationsEnabled=true sdk=31 permissionGranted=n_a_pre_33`. Permission/channel state is clean — flakiness is NOT a permission/channel cause.

**Primary finding (architect, 2026-05-23):** All notifications for one conversation share `notificationId = conversationId.hashCode() = 687143777` (`tag = null`). Android's documented behaviour for `notify(int, Notification)` with the same id is **update** — every new arrival **replaces** the previous heads-up in the same slot. This is not a notification-pipeline bug — the pipeline works exactly as instrumented. It IS the UX bug Vladislav noticed as "notifications sometimes disappear after firing": they didn't disappear, they were replaced. The fix is a notification *policy* decision, not a pipeline plumbing fix. Tracked as **PR-NOTIF-POLICY1** (mini-lock authored same day; Variant A vs Variant B decision at mini-lock review).

**Secondary finding (unrelated to notifications):** Vladislav surfaced "когда приходят сообщения, а ты находишься не в самом чате, и заходишь в чат с контактом, почему-то автоматом не скроллится вниз на новые сообщения". UI bug; not a notification-pipeline bug. Tracked as **PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1** (mini-lock authored same day).

**Discipline checkpoint.** Held scope strictly: didn't change `notificationId` strategy / channel config / `NotificationCompat.Builder` visuals / permission re-ask UX / FG-service notification, even though the perezatiranie finding stared us in the face. The right place for those changes is PR-NOTIF-POLICY1, not this PR.

**Open follow-ups generated by this track (added to consolidated queue):**

- **PR-UI-CHAT-AUTOSCROLL1** — fix `ChatScreen` not scrolling to bottom on open when unread messages arrived in the background. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/chat-autoscroll.md`. Architect's recommendation: do this BEFORE the notification policy because it's a more visible UX bug that Vladislav already noticed by hand.
- **PR-NOTIF-POLICY1** — conversation-level notification with `InboxStyle` summary + unread count + clear-on-chat-open. Mini-lock at `docs/tracks/notif-policy.md`. Variant A (recommended) vs Variant B (per-message) decision deferred to mini-lock review.

### 2026-05-22 (fri) · PR-UI-REC-FOLLOWUP — metadata-derived voice duration + empty-voice gate

Closed PR #210 (`feat/pr-ui-rec-followup-duration-empty-race` → master `a625bde7`). One commit, one file (`ChatScreen.kt`), +92 / −5 lines. Test #77 PASS on Tecno (Vladislav verdict).

**What shipped.** Two fundamentals left over from REC2.4 / REC3:

1. **Recording-duration source fix.** Replaced the 100 ms ticker (Test #76.5b reproducer: `durationMs=8000` on a ~12 s voice; the ticker pauses or is destroyed across some Compose state transitions and undercounts ~33 % on long voices) with `MediaMetadataRetriever.METADATA_KEY_DURATION` read off the finished file after `stop()`. New private helper `readAudioDurationMs(file)` wraps the retriever in `runCatching` + `try { } finally { release() }`; returns `Long?` so the caller can fall back if the retriever cannot extract a positive value (some AAC_ELD-on-API-26–28 encoder edge cases). The `VOICE_REC complete` log now carries both `durationMs` (the final value used everywhere downstream) and `tickerMs` (old value, for diagnostic attribution) + `source=metadata|ticker_fallback`.
2. **Empty-voice safety gate.** New private constants `MIN_SENDABLE_VOICE_DURATION_MS = 700L` and `MIN_SENDABLE_VOICE_BYTES = 1024L` next to `MIN_HOLD_SEND_MS`. New gate inside `finalizeAndSendVoice` runs after `readBytes()` + `readAudioDurationMs`: if `finalDurationMs < 700` OR `bytes.size < 1024`, log `VOICE_REC drop_empty durationMs=… tickerMs=… bytes=… source=… reason=too_short_or_empty`, `runCatching { file.delete() }`, `return@launch`. The outer `finally` still resets `voiceSendInProgress`. Catches the warm-up race the gesture-layer 700 ms `MIN_HOLD_SEND_MS` cannot catch (Test #76.3 class: `heldMs=819 durationMs=0`, file ~98 bytes — gesture passed the gate but `MediaRecorder` produced nothing playable).

**Test #77 data points (Vladislav, real device).** Ticker undercount confirmed and fixed:

- Scenario A (3–5 sec): `heldMs=4239 tickerMs=3100 metadata=3718` — metadata wins.
- Scenario B (10–12 sec): `heldMs=11306 tickerMs=9900 metadata=11118` — ticker would have undercounted to 9.9 s on what was an 11.3 s hold.
- Scenario C (locked-send, ~14 s from recorder start to Send tap): `tickerMs=12600 metadata=14038` — metadata matches wall-clock; the ~3 s gap user perceived as "wait, it's 11 s" was actually the gap between locked-entry and Send-tap, not a duration miscount.
- Scenarios D (swipe-cancel) and E (sub-700 ms tap): no `VOICE_REC complete`, no `MEDIA_TX upload_*`, no new LazyColumn row — gesture-layer cancels still work, `drop_empty` gate is dormant in this run because every short tap was caught earlier by `MIN_HOLD_SEND_MS`. The new gate's branch is reachable; it just didn't trigger in the run because Vladislav couldn't reproduce the warm-up race today.

**Discipline checkpoint.** Third PR end-to-end under `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` (REC3 → PR-DOC-HONESTY → REC-FOLLOWUP). Mini-lock authored before code per rule 3 (the `rec-followup.md` lock landed inside PR #209 closing PR-DOC-HONESTY). Held scope strictly: group voice path (`GroupChatScreen.kt` `sendGroupAudio`) was tempting because it has the same bug class, but it was explicitly out-of-scope per the mini-lock; left untouched, logged as a follow-up in this entry. Rule 4 parking threshold never reached.

**Open follow-ups (added by this track):**

- **Group voice durationMs + empty-voice guard** — `GroupChatScreen.kt` `sendGroupAudio` still ships ticker `recordingDurationMs` and has no empty-voice gate. Same bug class as 1:1; needs a separate group-durability track because the group voice path also lacks durable chunk storage keyed by `groupId` (per the D2b.1 commit note). No urgency until group voice surfaces as a tested feature.
- **`tickerMs=` field cleanup** — once a few more real-device sessions confirm the metadata source is reliable, the `tickerMs=` field in the `VOICE_REC complete` log can be removed. It's there only for diagnostic attribution during the adoption phase.

### 2026-05-21 (thu, late) · PR-DOC-HONESTY — documentation honesty pass

Closed PR #208 (`docs/pr-doc-honesty` → master `d953b131`). Single PR, three logical commits, no code changes. Brings the project's docs from pre-M1w / pre-M2 / pre-REC state up to the production reality on master `8f4c68c9`. This is the second PR worked end-to-end under `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` (REC3 was the first).

- **`docs(known-issues): align with M1w/M2/REC reality (post-Alpha-1)`** (`1adc2d1e`) — `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` 451 → 605 lines. Title retitled "PHANTOM Alpha 1 — Known Issues" → "PHANTOM — Known Issues" (post-Alpha-1, no fixed release deadline). ISSUE-001 rewritten to cover the half-open TCP middlebox class diagnosed in PR-H1b + H1c/H1e Run C locked policy. ISSUE-004 marked ✅ RESOLVED by PR-H2b. ISSUE-006 marked ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED. ISSUE-014 post-pivot. ISSUE-017 reframed under M1w. New ISSUE-018 (Tele2 Layer A WS), ISSUE-019 (Tele2 Layer B POST), ISSUE-020 (single-relay media ceiling 2400 b on v2 / ~3 × headroom on v3), ISSUE-021 (native OkHttp fresh-client-per-call pattern for RU LTE), ISSUE-022 (first-message bootstrap ~10–20 s delay), ISSUE-023 (receiver-side media cancel unsupported; blocks M2e re-enable).
- **`docs(adr,timeline): advance ADRs and kill superseded deadlines`** (`94bace93`) — ADR-011 `proposed` → `Accepted` (PR-H1c `e946caba` + PR-H1e `bcc501be`, Run C policy locked). ADR-023 `proposed` → `Accepted` (PR #56 `d862f3d0`; implementation footprint verified by grep on `KeystoreBlobCipher`, `AndroidKeystoreBlobCipher`, `SqlDelightLocal*PreKeyRepository.privateKeyCipher`, `AndroidKeystoreBlobCipherTest`). MASTER_TIMELINE: every calendar item killed by the 2026-05-14 strategic pivot + 2026-05-12 grants pivot marked with strikethrough + one-line cause line per Vladislav's lock #2 (June 1 release / June secondary funding / 25-day plan / NLnet draft V2 / FLOSS submission / Tag `v0.1.0-alpha.2` / June–July phased calendar / July-Sept / Oct-Dec / Q1 2027 / Phase 5 UnifiedPush 2027).
- **`docs(log): refresh current state and consolidate Open follow-ups`** (`ac15797c`) — new "What works today (master `8f4c68c9`, 2026-05-21)" block under the preserved Alpha-1 baseline. Consolidated "Vladislav-locked order, 2026-05-21" queue at the top of Open follow-ups (REC-FOLLOWUP → notifications diag → D1e → network matrix → calls → voice A/B). "Deferred individual items" + "Historical / paused" preserved.

**Discipline checkpoint.** Mini-lock (`docs/tracks/doc-honesty.md`) authored before scope per WORKING_RULES rule 3. Three logical commits inside one PR per Vladislav's PR-format lock. Strikethrough-not-delete per his cleanup lock. ADR-023 status decision gated on `git log --grep` + grep verification, not on optimism, per his ADR lock. Out-of-scope findings during the docs pass stayed logged as deferred follow-ups (e.g. text-bubble status icons under ISSUE-006). No "fix in passing" code edits — diff is strictly five docs files.

**Locked next-session start: PR-UI-REC-FOLLOWUP.** Recording-duration source fix (Test #76.5b: `durationMs=8000` on a ~12 s voice; the 100 ms ticker undercounts vs `MediaMetadataRetriever`) + empty-voice race (Test #76.3: `hold_release_send heldMs=819 durationMs=0`, gesture release passed the 700 ms gate but `MediaRecorder` hadn't captured anything). Both fix sites are inside `finalizeAndSendVoice`, not at the gesture layer — a mini-lock for that PR will be authored before code per WORKING_RULES rule 3.

### 2026-05-21 (thu, late) · PR-UI-REC3 SwipeCancel state visual

Closed PR #205 (`feat/pr-ui-rec3-swipecancel-visual` → master `770e61f4`). Five iterations on a single feature branch — a textbook execution of the new `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` one-PR-per-layer + mini-lock + iterate-on-the-same-branch discipline:

- **REC3** (`48a0f9fe`) — initial SwipeCancel render branch added to `InputBar`'s `recordingState != null` block: trail gradient (`Danger.22 → Danger.04`), dashed threshold marker at 72 %, trash handle on the right edge, "SWIPE TO DISCARD" hint, live % indicator, side-control dim to 0.4, both themes via existing tokens. Gesture detector untouched — REC2.4's swipe-left shim was already producing the cancel; REC3 made it *visible*.
- **REC3.1** (`bb511e3c`) — Test #76.6 fix: replaced two `align()` overlays with a single Row + weight=1 ellipsis hint so the % stopped overlapping the text; killed the latching `swipeCancelArmed` flag so the user can drag past 56 dp and back below it without arming-then-being-stuck. Release decision now uses live `finalDragLeftPx = (downX - change.position.x).coerceAtLeast(0f)` so what the user sees on the % indicator matches the actual gesture outcome.
- **REC3.2** (`1ff8a81a`) — shortened the hint to `"discard"` (matching Vladislav's screenshot) and added an animated arrow nudge via `rememberInfiniteTransition` + `animateFloat(targetValue = -3f)` so the affordance reads as motion-toward-discard.
- **REC3.3** (`70990a38`) — hide the Pause/Resume in-panel control while in press-hold Recording (`isPressHoldRecording = recordingState == Recording && isMicHeld`). Reasoning: the user's finger is on the mic, so they can't reach the in-panel button with the same finger anyway, and showing it during a hold-gesture was visual noise. Pause reappears in Locked, Paused, and Resumed-from-Paused.
- **REC3.4** (`2e0b3260`) — Test #76.6c fix: stopped flipping `isMicHeld = false` in the swipe-haptic block. That flip was carrying two responsibilities since REC2.4 — hiding the lock-hint chip at the 56 dp threshold AND (since REC3.3) gating Pause/Resume. When the user swiped past 56 dp, isMicHeld flipped, Pause reappeared briefly. Moved chip-hiding to a `swipeDragLeftPx <= swipeVisibleThresholdPx` check on the Popup so chip and Pause are gated by separate, intent-matching flags.

Test #76.6d PASS confirmed by Vladislav on real device — chip hidden through swipe, Pause hidden through press-hold, cancel arms/disarms cleanly, lock and paused render unchanged.

**Discipline checkpoint.** This is the first PR worked end-to-end under the new `docs/WORKING_RULES.md`. The mini-lock (`docs/tracks/rec3-swipecancel-visual.md`) was authored before the first commit per rule 3, with explicit scope / out-of-scope / parking conditions. Five iterations later, every fix was inside the agreed scope (UI render branch only, gesture-detector untouched, no transport / crypto / DB / chunk-size changes). Out-of-scope findings (durationMs source, empty-voice race, M2e re-enable, receiver-side cancel, notifications) stayed logged in `Open follow-ups`, none were "fixed in passing" per rule 7. No architectural reset was needed (rule 4 parking threshold never reached).

**Known follow-ups (open after REC3).** Same list as the prior session — REC3 was a visual layer over the already-shipped REC2.4 gesture, so the queue is unchanged:

1. **PR-UI-REC-FOLLOWUP** — recording duration source (ticker undercounts vs `MediaMetadataRetriever`).
2. **Empty-voice race** when `heldMs >= 700` but `durationMs <= 0` — fix inside `finalizeAndSendVoice`, not at the gesture layer.
3. **Re-enable M2e early manifest** once the relay grows a receiver-side media-cancel protocol.
4. **Receiver download cancel** needs new relay endpoints.
5. **Notifications flakiness diagnostic PR.**
6. **Doc honesty PR** — KNOWN_ISSUES expansion (Tele2 Layer A/B, M1w/M2 trilogy, REC*), ADR-011/-023 status advance, MASTER_TIMELINE killed-deadlines cleanup. Deferred from earlier today; now next on the queue.

### 2026-05-21 (thu, late) · Branch prune

Branch prune: deleted 6 stale branches per delete-blind policy. List: `feat/pr-m2b-download-parallelism`, `feat/pr-d2b2-flip-canSendVoice-and-15s-cap`, `pr-d1b-rest-fallback-wireup` (3 commits — diff-verified as squash-merged via PR-D1b #157/#158), `fix/prekey-publish-reliability`, `feat/probe-step-observability`, `docs/2026-05-15-merge-update`. Retained per memory: `diag/m2c0-media-route-probe`, `fix/transport-tcp-keepalive`, `infra/media-ro-bridge2-cotenant`. Side-finding (deferred for triage): 117 additional local branches still `[gone]` on origin — broader sweep awaiting Vladislav's call.

Branch prune (docs/*, 2026-05-21 follow-up): deleted 24 local-only docs/* branches per delete-blind policy (all ≤ 1 commit ahead of master and content squash-merged). 21 were already `[gone]` on origin (Tor / H1 / H2 / G3-G4 / M2 / Track A/B / NLnet-drafts / security-roadmap / Firebase-rotation / day-1-2-4 recap commits); 3 had no live remote tracking. List delegated to the commit message; no retained docs/* exceptions. 93 non-docs `[gone]` local branches remain — pruned later if/when Vladislav greenlights a broader sweep.

### 2026-05-21 (thu) · Voice recorder UX hardening — PR #197 Recording Panel Matrix states 3+4 (REC2 trilogy) + PR #198 outgoing-voice upload cancel (CANCEL trilogy)

**Branch state.** Two PRs squash-merged in sequence: `52a9773f` (#197 PR-UI-REC2 Locked + hold-to-lock + REC2.1 routing fix + REC2.2 lifecycle rewrite + REC2.3 gesture state machine + REC2.4 Locked-send routing + swipe-left-cancel + recorder crash hardening) and `b117dcb9` (#198 PR-MEDIA-UPLOAD-CANCEL1 + CANCEL2 + CANCEL2.1). Each PR went through 4–5 iterations driven by real-device test verdicts (#76, #76.1, #76.1.1, #76.1.2, #76.2, #76.3, #76.4, #76.5, #76.5b) before the architect signed off. All branches deleted on remote. Zero `AndroidRuntime` / `IllegalStateException` / `sha256_mismatch` / `decrypt_failed` / `media_chunks_gone` across the final passing test rounds.

**Context.** After 2026-05-20 closed REC1 (Recording + Paused states), the recorder UX still had three open ends: a Locked-hands-free state that the visual already supports but no gesture reached; a swipe-to-cancel state for accidental hold-mid-press; and an X-button on the uploading bubble that was a visual-only placeholder (`/* PR-UI follow-up — wire cancellation */`). Today's session closed Locked + the safety guardrail for swipe-left + the upload cancellation; SwipeCancel-state visual is queued as PR-UI-REC3 separately.

**PR-UI-REC2 (PR #197) — Locked state + WhatsApp-style hold-to-lock gesture.** Took five iterations to get the gesture lifecycle right. The original REC2 commit shipped a long-press-timeout-based detector inside `awaitEachGesture { … awaitPointerEvent() … if (elapsed >= longPressTimeoutMs) … }` plus a single `pointerInput(Unit)` Box that was supposed to host both mic-press and send-text/send-voice taps. Test #76 caught an immediate blocker: tapping the cyan Send-text arrow with text in the input field started a voice recording because the gesture detector dispatched every plain tap as a mic tap regardless of visual mode. REC2.1 (`3789223d`) fixed routing via `rememberUpdatedState` snapshots of `text` / `recordingState` / `isEditing` taken at press-down, plus defence-in-depth `inputText.trim().isNotEmpty()` guards inside both start-recording paths.

Test #76.1 PASSED routing but exposed the next layer: REC2.1's hold detection only kicked the recorder off at the long-press boundary, so a user holding the mic for ~500 ms got only ~14 ms of audio before they released (MediaRecorder.start() warm-up consumed the rest). Result: `VOICE_REC complete durationMs=0 bytes=98` ghost voice every short hold. REC2.2 (`bae8ba38`) moved the `startChatRecording(...)` call to press-down via `onMicClick()` so the recorder ran for the full press duration; the long-press timeout became cosmetic (lock-chip visibility + slide-up detector arming) and never restarted the recorder. Added `MIN_HOLD_SEND_MS = 700` gate so a hold + release inside the cancel zone dropped the recording silently instead of shipping a near-empty voice. Removed the dead `onMicPressHold` callback.

Test #76.1.2 PASSED short-hold safety but uncovered the structural bug: `awaitPointerEvent()` does not fire ticks for a stationary finger. An 8-second hold without movement produced ZERO pointer events between ACTION_DOWN and ACTION_UP, so `elapsed >= longPressTimeoutMs` was never evaluated, `didStartHold` stayed false, release fell through to "quick tap", and REC1 hands-free was the only outcome the user ever saw. REC2.3 (`11ca8168`) was a full rewrite as a real ACTION_DOWN / drag / ACTION_UP state machine — recording starts synchronously at press-down via `onMicDownStartRecording: () -> Boolean` (owns capability / busy / text-not-empty / permission guards), `onMicHoldReleaseSend(heldMs)` / `onMicHoldTooShortCancel(heldMs)` / `onMicSlideUpLock()` / `onSendVoiceTap()` callbacks map cleanly to pointer-up outcomes. REC1's tap-to-record hands-free was retired in this rewrite; user wanting hands-free now uses hold + slide-up-to-lock (WhatsApp parity). Right-side button split into two mutually-exclusive Boxes — text-mode (plain `clickable(onSend)`, **no** mic pointerInput) and mic-mode (persistent across mic ↔ send-voice with the new gesture detector).

Test #76.2 PASSED basic recording + Locked-entry but reproduced three new blockers Vladislav caught in a single session: tapping in-panel Send while in Locked state did not finalise the voice (logs showed `ignored_start reason=busy state=Locked` instead of `send_voice_tap`); dragging finger right-to-left then releasing after 700 ms actually SENT the voice instead of cancelling; the app crashed when `MediaRecorder.stop()` ran on a too-short / stale recorder. REC2.4 (`9e9c736e`) fixed all three: `currentIsSendVoiceVisual = rememberUpdatedState(recordingState != null)` so the gesture detector reads the LIVE visual mode (the plain `val isSendVoiceVisual` outside `pointerInput(Unit)` was frozen at first composition as `false`); new interim `swipeCancelArmed` flag tripped when `downX - change.position.x >= 56 dp` while pressed so a horizontal-only gesture cancels via the new `onMicHoldSwipeCancel(heldMs)` callback instead of falling into release-to-send; new `stopReleaseRecorderSafely(reason: String)` helper used by every recorder teardown path (`DisposableEffect.onDispose`, `finalizeAndSendVoice`, `onCancelRecording`, the capability-disabled tear-down, `onMicHoldTooShortCancel`, the new swipe-cancel) — nullifies the field BEFORE calling stop so a re-entrant teardown cannot double-stop, then `runCatching` both `stop()` and `release()` with a `VOICE_REC stop_failed reason=…` / `release_failed` log on failure. No raw `mediaRecorder?.stop()` remains in ChatScreen.

**Test #76.3 PASS** verified the full REC2 acceptance matrix on the merged build: `hold_record_start` at press-down, `locked_entered reason=hold_slide_up` on slide-up, `send_voice_tap state=Locked` → `locked_send` → `VOICE_REC complete` → `MEDIA_TX upload_complete` end-to-end, no `ignored_start reason=busy` after Lock, no `IllegalStateException`. SwipeCancel state visual (trail / trash icon / threshold animation) is still PR-UI-REC3 territory; REC2.4's swipe-left gesture is the smallest shim that closes the data-loss bug without rendering the full UX.

**PR-MEDIA-UPLOAD-CANCEL1 (PR #198) — wire the X button on outgoing uploading voice bubbles.** Three iterations. The architect carved this out as its own PR because the X-button-noop was a separate pre-existing bug surfaced by Test #76.3 (the recording / locked / swipe / crash fixes from REC2.4 were already correct), so we cut a fresh branch from `52a9773f` rather than bundling into REC2.

CANCEL1 (`a4e68102`) wired the full path end-to-end: `MessagingService.cancelVoiceUpload(conversationId, localMsgId): Result<Unit>` interface entry, `DefaultMessagingService` holds in-flight uploads in `voiceUploadJobs: MutableMap<localMsgId, Job>` (guarded by `voiceUploadJobsLock: Mutex`), `sendAudioV2` populates the map right after `scope.launch { … }` and removes in `finally`. `VoiceV2Sender.uploadVoice` + `uploadWithNetworkRetry` got `coroutineContext.ensureActive()` checkpoints before/after each chunk upload and each retry-backoff `delay`. UI: `AudioBubble.onCancelUpload: (() -> Unit)?` (null → X glyph hidden — receiver download bubbles intentionally don't show a tappable no-op), `MessageBubble.onReloadMessages: () -> Unit` (pinhole back to ChatScreen so the LazyColumn snapshot refreshes after the cancelled row is deleted).

Test #76.4 caught **five compounding architectural bugs** the architect spelled out one by one. CANCEL2 (`7635a134`) fixed them all in one commit:

1. **`runCatching` in `VoiceV2Sender.uploadVoice` swallowed CancellationException.** `runCatching` catches every `Throwable` including the cancellation. The cancel marker was converted into a normal `Result.failure(...)` and the `catch (CancellationException)` in DMS never ran. Replaced with explicit `try { Result.success(uploadVoiceInner(…)) } catch (ce: CancellationException) { throw } catch (t: Throwable) { Result.failure(t) }`. Body extracted into private `uploadVoiceInner` for readability.

2. **Early manifest poisoned the receiver after a cancel.** `sendAudioV2` was firing the manifest envelope after the first ~2 chunks (M2e overlap). A user cancel after that point left the receiver knowing about a media the sender then refused to complete — the receiver started downloading and got stuck on `MEDIA_RX chunk_not_ready_yet … reason=media_chunks_gone`. Until the relay grows a real receiver-side media-cancel / chunk-delete protocol there is no safe way to retract a manifest. `sendAudioV2` now passes `onEarlyManifest = null` and falls through to a single tail `sendManifestEnvelope(manifest)` after `uploadResult.isSuccess`. M2e overlap is temporarily disabled in favour of correct cancellation semantics; re-enable is queued as a follow-up that depends on the relay-side protocol.

3. **DMS cleanup was cancellable.** The `finally` block held a few suspend points (`Mutex.withLock`, `mediaProgressBus.clear`); once the upload coroutine entered the cancelled state every suspend re-threw `CancellationException`, aborted the rest of the cleanup, and left `voiceSendInProgress` stuck (Vladislav: "приложение не даёт записать новое голосовое"). Wrapped the entire catch+finally in `withContext(NonCancellable) { … }` so every suspend completes regardless of cancellation state.

4. **`job.cancel()` returned immediately.** UI side called `cancel()` and immediately ran `onReloadMessages()`, but the catch+finally inside the upload coroutine had not yet deleted the local row, so the reload still saw the cancelled bubble. Added `job.cancel(...)` → `job.join()` → new `MEDIA_TX upload_cancel_joined` log. UI-side reload only fires after the join returns.

5. **CancellationException marker matched too narrowly.** Depending on the wrap path inside the coroutine machinery, the marker can land on `ce.cause?.message` instead of `ce.message`. Added private helper `CancellationException.isUserUploadCancel()` that checks both.

Test #76.5 PASSED functionally — cancel actually stopped the upload, no `upload_complete`, no `early_manifest_sent`, no `media_chunks_gone` on the emulator, sender could record again. But the architect spotted that the DMS-side cancel logs were missing from logcat. CANCEL2.1 (`7684994a`) closed the diagnostic gap: `DefaultMessagingService.messagingLog(...)` writes under tag `PhantomMessaging`, while every test session uses the filter `PhantomMedia:V PhantomUI:V PhantomTransport:V *:S` which silences `PhantomMessaging`. By contrast `VoiceV2Sender` already takes a `log: (String) -> Unit` callback wired by `AppContainer` to `Log.i("PhantomMedia", …)`. The fix: new constructor parameter `DefaultMessagingService.mediaLog: (String) -> Unit = {}`, AppContainer wires `mediaLog = { msg -> Log.i("PhantomMedia", msg) }`, every cancel-path log site (`upload_cancel_requested` / `upload_cancel_dispatched` / `upload_cancel_joined` / `upload_cancel_noop` / `upload_cancelled_by_user` / `upload_job_cancelled`) writes through BOTH `messagingLog(...)` (existing tag preserved for the messaging history) AND `mediaLog(...)` (new PhantomMedia tag visible under the standard logcat filter). No behaviour change — pure observability fix.

**Test #76.5b PASS** confirmed the full cancel chain on Tecno Tele2 LTE → emulator: `MEDIA_UI upload_cancel_tap` → `MEDIA_TX upload_cancel_requested` → `MEDIA_TX upload_cancel_dispatched` → `MEDIA_TX upload_cancelled_by_user manifestSent=false` → `MEDIA_TX upload_cancel_joined` → `ChatScreen reloadMessages loaded=12` (was 13 before cancel). The in-flight `idx=2` chunk completed after cancel (acceptable — already on the wire); `idx=3` never started; no `manifest_sent`; no `upload_complete`; bubble disappeared from the LazyColumn; sender immediately recorded another voice without the legacy "voice is still uploading" lock.

**Known follow-ups (open):**

1. **PR-UI-REC3** — full SwipeCancel state visual (trail gradient, trash icon, dashed threshold border, 72 % distance indicator, disabled Send/Resume controls). Currently REC2.4's swipe-left handler cancels at gesture level but the visual stays as Recording during the swipe — REC3 will surface the cancel intent before release.
2. **PR-UI-REC-FOLLOWUP — recording duration source.** Test #76.5b logs show `VOICE_REC complete durationMs=8000` on a voice Vladislav reports as ~12 seconds. The ticker-based `recordingDurationMs` undercounts (likely because the timer ticker exits during state transitions). Right fix is to use `MediaMetadataRetriever` duration after `stop()`, or accumulate real elapsed session time, rather than the 100-ms ticker.
3. **Empty-voice race.** Test #76.3 logs show `hold_release_send heldMs=819 durationMs=0` — gesture release passed the 700 ms gate but MediaRecorder hadn't captured anything. The right fix is a `durationMs`-based check inside `finalizeAndSendVoice` (drop the row if `recordingDurationMs <= some minimum`), not another gesture-layer change.
4. **Re-enable M2e early manifest** once the relay grows a receiver-side media-cancel / chunk-delete protocol. Until then `sendAudioV2` ships voices sequentially (upload → tail manifest → download); long voices take longer than they did at the M2e baseline. Pure trade-off for safe cancellation.
5. **Receiver download cancel** needs new relay endpoints (chunk-delete / mediaId-revoke) before the receiver-side X can do anything useful. Hidden in this PR; tracked separately.
6. **Notifications flakiness** still on the queue from Test #75 — diagnostic PR before any fix attempt.

**Memory entries.** No new entries created; the voice-recorder gesture model is captured in the inline `// PR-UI-REC2.x` and `// PR-MEDIA-UPLOAD-CANCEL2.x` source comments rather than as agent-memory entries (where they would rot quickly against the next iteration).

### 2026-05-20 (wed) · Voice UI polish day — PR #192 Voice Bubble Matrix + PR #193 M2h.1 fresh-default + PR #194 AudioBubble playback + PR #195 Recording Panel Matrix states 1+2

**Branch state.** Four PRs squash-merged into master in sequence: `62fa397e` (#192 Voice Bubble Matrix + midnight day-sep + text-bubble timestamp footer), `d50c8e31` (#193 PR-M2h.1 — `useDownloadPool` default flipped `true → false` after Test #72), `b0f2b135` (#194 PR-UI-VB1 — AudioBubble pause keeps progress + preload duration + 4-state label), `08ccf906` (#195 PR-UI-REC1 — RecordingPanel composable wiring states 1 + 2). All four branches deleted on remote. Three real-device test rounds (Test #73 on the combined M2h.1 + VBM build, Test #74 on VB1, Test #75 on REC1) — every round green on Tecno Tele2 LTE + emulator with zero `sha256_mismatch` / `decrypt_failed` / `media_chunks_gone` / `AndroidRuntime` / `java.lang.*`.

**Context.** After M2f.2 closed the transport-layer voice-delivery work on 2026-05-19, the dominant remaining track was visual polish on the voice surface (recording panel, sent bubble, received bubble, playback state) plus the M2h pooled-download verdict from Test #72. The day chained those four PRs sequentially — each one shipped as its own APK, tested on real hardware, merged on PASS, before the next branch was cut from a fresh master. No batched APKs ("M2h.1 + VBM + VB1 + REC1 in one build") so that any regression could be attributed to a single PR.

**PR-M2h.1 — flip `useDownloadPool` default `true → false` after Test #72.** Test #72 (run 2026-05-19) had probed M2h's pooled-OkHttp download path on the emulator and on Tecno over Tele2 LTE. The emulator returned ~100 ms / chunk on the pooled path — a real speed-up over fresh-per-call. But on Tecno the **first** pooled GET stalled 10 013 ms with `InterruptedIOException` before the sticky pool-disable guard tripped; the safety net then carried the voice through on fresh-per-call without integrity errors. Architect verdict: pool reuse is a real win on healthy routes, but a 10-second extra delay on every first incoming voice over Tele2-class networks is too costly to ship as the production default. PR-M2h.1 (`shared/core/transport/.../AndroidNativeOkHttpMediaUploadTransport.kt`) flipped only the default value (`@Volatile private var useDownloadPool: Boolean = true → false`) and added `fun setDownloadPoolEnabled(enabled: Boolean)` so a debug Settings toggle or future adaptive-per-network probe can flip the pool on at runtime; the sticky-disable logic, `POOL_STALL_THRESHOLD_MS`, `download_pool_fallback` telemetry, and the entire pooled `OkHttpClient` instance remain in code. No transport / relay / chunk-size / parallelism / crypto changes. Test #73 (run on the combined M2h.1 + VBM build) confirmed every `MEDIA_V3 download_start` line carried `mode=fresh` from `idx=0` on both devices — zero `mode=pooled`, zero `download_pool_fallback`. M2h closed as fresh-default with pool-as-runtime-opt-in; the adaptive A/B probe (background `n×` healthy round-trips → enable pool for this network) is deferred to a future PR.

**PR #192 — Voice Bubble Matrix (sent + received voice bubbles) + midnight day-separator tick + text-bubble timestamp footer.** Three orthogonal visual fixes bundled per Vladislav's preference for one-PR-per-track on UI work. (a) **Voice Bubble Matrix visual.** The old `AudioBubble` was a single Surface2 pill with a 36-bar fixed-shape waveform that could overflow the canvas on narrow widths, a double-bordered parent `MessageBubble` frame around it, and a Stop glyph instead of Pause during playback. The Matrix design (`D:\VL Stories Studio\Phantom - Messengers-handoff\phantom-messengers\project\Voice Bubble Matrix.html`) ships a 36 dp disc on the left (cyan-dark `#0099BB` background while playing, surface-elevated otherwise, with a rotating arc during load), a scrolling 36-bar waveform whose bars scale to the canvas width via `Canvas` `drawRoundRect`, a right-column percent-or-duration label in JetBrains Mono, and a footer meta row (`HH:MM` + status icon + speed pill). Parent `MessageBubble` drops the double frame for audio rows so AudioBubble fully owns the visual. Pause glyph swapped from Stop (square) to two distinct vertical bars. (b) **Midnight day-separator tick.** `ChatDateSep` had been computing its "TODAY" / "YESTERDAY" label from `Calendar.getInstance()` directly, but Compose marks the composable as skippable on `(millis: Long)`, so once the chat had been rendered before midnight the separator captured the label once and never recomposed after 00:00 — yesterday's messages stayed labelled "TODAY" while new ones also showed "TODAY" (Vladislav screenshot 2026-05-20). Fix: hoist the start-of-today wall-clock into a screen-level `rememberDayStartMillis()` state that delays past the next local midnight and refreshes itself via `LaunchedEffect`; `ChatDateSep` now takes the `dayStartMillis` parameter and the label recomposes whenever the state ticks. (c) **Text-bubble timestamp footer.** The single-line text bubble used a `Box` overlay (Text with 36/56 dp end-padding + Row aligned `BottomEnd`), which made the bubble grow to widest-wrapped-line + the reserved padding. When the *last* wrapped line was short (e.g. "идут долго") that left a visible empty gap between the text end and the timestamp. Fix: drop the overlay, stack the meta row below the text inside the existing bubble Column with `Modifier.align(End)` on the meta — bubble now hugs the widest wrapped line and the meta sits tight on its own footer row, consistent with the new AudioBubble meta layout. **Test #73** verified all three on Tecno + emu: voice bubbles single-framed and waveform-scaled, day separator showed "TODAY" only for today's messages (full midnight-rollover behaviour is a quieter follow-up that needs an actual 00:00 crossing to verify), multi-line text bubbles hugged their content with no whitespace before the timestamp.

**PR-UI-VB1 — AudioBubble playback fixes (pause keeps progress + preload duration).** Two playback UX bugs Vladislav caught on Test #73 with the VBM build: (1) `val waveProgress = if (isPlaying) playProgress else 0f` zeroed the waveform the moment the user tapped Pause, so paused looked identical to stop; the right-column label also collapsed to total-only, hiding the elapsed time. (2) `durationMs` was only set inside `togglePlayback()` after `MediaPlayer.prepare()`, so every voice in the chat showed `—:——` until the first tap of Play. Architect's review of Test #73 confirmed both as the primary blockers. Fix: (a) `waveProgress = playProgress` always — `MediaPlayer.onCompletionListener` is the single owner of the reset back to 0. (b) Right-column label has four states wired explicitly: idle ready (total only), playing (`current / total`), paused-with-progress (`current / total` — driven by a derived `hasPlaybackPosition = playProgress > 0 && < 0.999`), completed (total only after `onCompletion` zeroes `playProgress`). (c) New `LaunchedEffect(plaintextCache, isLoading)` extracts duration via `MediaMetadataRetriever` on `Dispatchers.IO` as soon as the bubble enters a ready state; for `[AUDIO_LOCAL:<path>]` the underlying VoiceFileStore file is read directly (no copy), for legacy `[AUDIO:<base64>]` bubbles the decoded bytes are written into `cacheDir` once and reused for both duration extraction and playback. (d) `togglePlayback()` seeks back to 0 when the MediaPlayer sits at the end of the clip — tapping Play after Completion now restarts the clip instead of returning instantly. The legacy temp-file is deleted on composable dispose; the underlying VoiceFileStore file is left alone. **Test #74** (VB1-only APK, sha256 `a372f653…`) on Tecno + emu PASS — emu downloaded a 9-chunk voice cleanly (`download_complete plainBytes=26804`), recorded a new 5.5-sec voice (`VOICE_REC complete durationMs=5500 bytes=25129`), no `pause_failed` / `resume_failed` / `AndroidRuntime` lines.

**PR-UI-REC1 — Recording Panel Matrix (states 1 + 2 only).** The recording panel handoff (`D:\VL Stories Studio\Phantom - Messengers-handoff Recording Panel\phantom-messengers\project\Recording Panel Matrix.html`) ships a 56 dp composer-row variant with four sub-states: Recording (live), Paused, Locked, SwipeCancel. Per Vladislav's confirm-message before implementation, this PR delivers **states 1 + 2 only** at the visual layer plus the state machine and amplitude poller needed for the remaining two to slot in cleanly later. (a) **`RecordingPanelState` enum** (Recording / Paused / Locked / SwipeCancel) — the two unreachable values are declared so PR-UI-REC2 (hold-to-lock) and PR-UI-REC3 (swipe-to-cancel) can add render branches without re-touching the state machine. (b) **State machine refactor:** `var isRecording: Boolean` → `var recordingState: RecordingPanelState?` in ChatScreen; new 100 ms timer LaunchedEffect runs only while state is Recording or Locked; new 80 ms amplitude poller LaunchedEffect calls `MediaRecorder.getMaxAmplitude()`, normalises to `[0..1]`, appends to a 64-entry SnapshotStateList ring buffer. The reset-to-0 of `recordingDurationMs` is owned by the start path (mic-button start + permissionLauncher), not by the ticker — a Recording → Paused → Recording round-trip preserves both `recordingDurationMs` and `recordingAmplitudes`, which fixes the architect's flagged "current LaunchedEffect(isRecording) resets recordingDurationMs to 0" pitfall. (c) **`MediaRecorder.pause() / resume()`** wired (API 24+; minSdk = 26 so no runtime guard). Errors logged as `VOICE_REC pause_failed` / `VOICE_REC resume_failed` but do not crash the panel. (d) **`RecordingPanel` composable** matches the Matrix design exactly — 56 dp row of Cancel · Center stack (8 dp Danger pulsing dot with aura `tween(500) Reverse` opacity 0 → 0.22 scale 0.7 → 1.0; JetBrains Mono 13 sp tabular-nums timer; DAW waveform with last 26 samples as "recent" / rest as "older"; PAUSED capsule when state = Paused) · Pause/Resume (44 dp Surface2 disc, glyph swap only) · Send (44 dp cyan disc, same as text composer). InputBar gates the new panel at the Column level — when `recordingState != null` the whole row is `RecordingPanel`, otherwise the row is the unchanged emoji + textfield + send/mic. The legacy "Recording 0:17" pill plus the per-side cancel(X) + send-arrow inside InputBar are gone. **Test #75** (REC1-only APK, sha256 `2ab815f9…`) on Tecno + emu PASS — multiple `VOICE_REC complete` + `MEDIA_TX upload_complete` cycles, no `pause_failed` / `resume_failed`, panel transitions Recording → Paused → Recording cleanly with `recordingDurationMs` preserved.

**Out of scope (queued).** State 3 Locked + hold-to-lock gesture → **PR-UI-REC2**. State 4 SwipeCancel + drag-gesture (drag the mic toward a discard threshold, trail + trash handle + disabled controls + return to Paused/Recording when released before the threshold) → **PR-UI-REC3**. Light theme variant — app is dark-only for Beta. The `RecordingPanelState` enum already includes the Locked + SwipeCancel values so REC2/REC3 add a render branch in `RecordingPanel`, a gesture handler in InputBar, and a new state transition — no state machine refactor required.

**Notification flakiness — separate diagnostic track.** Vladislav reported on Test #75 that notifications sometimes appear and sometimes don't, with occasional disappearance after firing. This pre-exists today's work (was not introduced by any of the four PRs that merged) and is explicitly out-of-scope for the voice-UI track. Queued as a diagnostic PR after REC2/REC3 lands — first step will be a logcat instrumentation PR similar to PR-Diag (#143) on the WS path, not a fix attempt, because the failure mode is not yet root-caused.

**Known follow-ups (open, not blocking the next track):**
1. **PR-UI-REC2** — Locked state + hold-to-lock gesture. Risk: current mic-button click is the start/stop toggle; layering a long-press → lock gesture on top of it needs care to avoid eating regular taps.
2. **PR-UI-REC3** — SwipeCancel state + drag gesture. Discard threshold with continuous visual feedback (red trail + dashed boundary + trash handle); release before threshold → return to Paused.
3. **Notification flakiness diagnostic PR** — logcat instrumentation only, no fix attempt yet.
4. **PR-D1e** — first-message bootstrap fast path (still open from M2 trilogy follow-ups).
5. **PR-M2h adaptive A/B** — eventually re-enable pool only on networks where a background probe passes; sits behind notifications + REC2/REC3 in priority.

**Memory entries.** No new entries created today — all four PRs are within the existing voice / UI tracks captured in `project_m2_track_status_2026_05_19.md`, `project_m2d_roadmap_2026_05_18.md`, and `feedback_voice_quality_priority.md`. The notification flakiness item is logged in the in-conversation todo list rather than memory because it has no root cause yet.

### 2026-05-19 (tue, evening) · M2f trilogy closed — production voice chunk size locked to 3200 bytes after Test #69/#70/#70.1/#70.2/#71

**Branch state.** Four PRs squash-merged into master in sequence: `ef74ada3` (M2f, binary `/media/v3` endpoints + media_capabilities advertisement), `9ab7f872` (M2f.1, debug-only Settings selector for chunk size), `c98b5c72` (M2f.1b, selector extended with 2800/3000/3200/3500), `ac310718` (M2f.2, production chunk size lock 1700 → 3200 + byte-based early manifest). All four branches deleted on remote. No code-level regressions observed across the five real-hardware test rounds; the only visible artefact carried forward is a UI-track follow-up.

**Context.** After PR-M2e shipped the upload/download overlap, the dominant cost on long voice was the chunk count itself — at 1700-byte raw ciphertext per chunk, a 30-second voice produced ~82 sequential HTTP round-trips on each side. PR-M2c.0 (2026-05-18) had concluded that bigger chunks weren't feasible on Tele2 LTE because the Helsinki path's full-roundtrip ceiling was ~2400 wire bytes. But that measurement was taken on the v2 JSON+Base64 path, where 1700 raw inflated to ~2388 wire bytes; the Tele2 ceiling was already nearly maxed before any chunk-size headroom. The M2f trilogy unwinds this by moving the wire format itself, then probing the real binary ceiling.

**PR-M2f — binary `/media/v3` endpoints (additive, v2 kept).** Adds `POST /media/v3/{mediaId}/{idx}?total=N` (raw ciphertext body, always 204 + `X-Chunk-Stored/Duplicate/Idx` + `ETag: "<sha256_hex>"`) and `GET /media/v3/{mediaId}/{idx}` (`application/octet-stream` body, `ETag` + `X-Chunk-Total`) alongside the legacy v2 pair. The v3 path shares the same in-memory `MediaStore` as v2 (idempotency by `sha256(ciphertext)`, same total/quota/idx checks). 7 new integration tests added to `services/relay/tests/media_endpoints.rs`; all 23 media tests pass. Capability discovery via the extensible `media_capabilities: { binary_v3: true, max_upload_body_bytes: N }` nested object in `/auth/session` response — older relays without the field default to `binary_v3=false` and the client stays on v2 (kotlinx-serialization safe default). `AndroidNativeOkHttpMediaUploadTransport` accepts a `binaryV3Enabled: () -> Boolean` lambda wired to `restOrchestrator.capabilities.value.mediaBinaryV3`, with a sticky 404/405 fallback to v2 that triggers only on the capability-stale runtime case (network errors stay in the existing retry loop). `RelayCapabilities` gains `mediaBinaryV3` and `mediaUploadBodyBytes` fields; `SAFE_DEFAULTS` keeps both off. **Test #69** confirmed: every upload chunk through `MEDIA_V3 upload_response status=204`, every download chunk through `MEDIA_V3 download_response status=200 bytes=1700`, zero `MEDIA_V3 fallback`, zero `MEDIA_HTTP` (v3 fully owns the path), voice playable both ends. Architect verdict: "M2f reduces wire overhead but does not change chunk count yet; download per-chunk RTT (~1.1s) is the new bottleneck — chunk-size bump next."

**PR-M2f.1 — debug-only chunk-size selector.** Adds `phantom.android.diagnostics.ChunkSizeProbe` with `isProbeAvailable = BuildConfig.DEBUG` and a 5-size candidate matrix (1700/2200/2300/2400/2600). `VoiceV2Sender.uploadVoice` accepts a `chunkSizeProvider: () -> Int` lambda (default `MediaChunker.TARGET_RAW_CHUNK_BYTES = 1700`), clamped `[1024, 8000]` as defence-in-depth, logged as `MEDIA_TX chunk_size_selected mediaId=... bytes=N source=provider` once per voice send (plus `chunkSizeBytes=N` added to the existing `chunk_split` log). Settings → Diagnostics shows a `DropdownMenu` only on debug builds; release strips the entire section. `AppContainer` wires the provider to `ChunkSizeProbe.currentValue(prefs)`. **Test #70** ran the matrix and all four sizes above 1700 passed full roundtrip Tecno → emu with zero integrity errors — including 2600 which had been seeded as a borderline negative control. The old "Tele2 ceiling ~2400" assumption was invalidated: on the v3 binary path the 33% JSON+Base64 inflation that v2 paid is gone, freeing ~600-700 bytes of headroom.

**PR-M2f.1b — selector extended with 2800/3000/3200/3500.** One-line PR. Vladislav-locked path B 2026-05-19: probe higher before locking production. **Test #70.1** ran the extended matrix Tecno upload → emu download; all four sizes passed with zero errors. But this proved only half — emu was always the receiver, so Tele2 download path wasn't tested. **Test #70.2** ran the matrix in reverse (emu sender, Tecno receiver on Tele2 LTE) for both ranges (2200/2300/2400/2600 + 2800/3000/3200/3500). All eight sizes passed full roundtrip. 3200 and 3500 logs showed several `MEDIA_RX chunk_not_ready_yet retry_in=1000ms` entries — this is the M2e early-manifest path doing exactly what it should: receiver overtakes sender tail-upload, gets 404 on a chunk that hasn't landed yet, backs off 1s, retries, succeeds. Architect verdict: "Tecno on Tele2 LTE downloads v3 binary chunks up to 3500 cleanly; the old 2400 ceiling does not apply on v3." Test #70.2 surfaced one UI-track follow-up: on 2800/3000 the receiver bubble briefly flashed "Downloading" again after `download_complete`, but the file was on disk and playable after re-entering the chat — a Compose state-refresh issue, not a transport regression.

**PR-M2f.2 — production lock 3200 + byte-based early manifest.** Per Vladislav's locked margin policy ("never ship max-passed-once; 3500 stable both directions → ship 3200"), `MediaChunker.TARGET_RAW_CHUNK_BYTES = 1700` → `3200`. Critical architectural fix bundled in the same PR: `VoiceV2Sender.EARLY_MANIFEST_AFTER_CHUNKS = 3` constant replaced with `EARLY_MANIFEST_AFTER_BYTES = 5100` + dynamic recompute `max(1, ceil(5100.0 / chunkSize)).coerceAtMost(total)`. The prior fixed value was tuned for 1700 (3 × 1700 = 5100 bytes proof-of-life). At 3200 it would have delayed the manifest to 9600 bytes — almost double the original M2e budget — and noticeably weakened the upload/download overlap. The byte-based formula yields 3 chunks at 1700/2400, 2 chunks at 3200/3500, preserving M2e timing across the entire chunk-size knob. `MediaChunkerTest` updated: one hard-coded `1700` literal replaced with the constant; misleading test method name dropped (others were already self-adapting). All 7 messaging tests green on JVM. Debug selector stays in DEBUG-only Settings for future M2h probes and a future voice-quality A/B. **Test #71** sanity (production parameters, both directions on Tele2 LTE Tecno + emu): `MEDIA_TX chunk_split chunkSizeBytes=3200` confirmed on both ends, `early_manifest_sent afterChunks=2 total=8/44` confirmed for long voice, zero `sha256_mismatch` / `decrypt_failed` / `media_chunks_gone` / `MEDIA_V3 fallback`.

**Production speed snapshot after M2f.2** (30-second voice on Tele2 LTE, both directions):

| Metric | Pre-M2 trilogy (1700) | After M2f.2 (3200) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Long-voice chunk count (Tecno-sized) | ~82 | ~44 | -46 % |
| Tele2 upload wall time | ~78 s | ~26 s | -67 % |
| Tele2 download wall time | ~90 s | ~15 s | -83 % |
| Emulator download wall time | ~90 s | ~48 s | -47 % |
| Total user-visible delay (`max(upload, download)`) | ~150 s | ~50 s | -67 % |

(Tecno download dropped further than Emu download because the path is now ~1.1 s/chunk for 22-44 chunks vs ~1.1 s/chunk for 82 chunks. The Emu path is the slower receiver in this matrix simply because the sender is also Tecno on Tele2 LTE; the per-chunk emu-side cost is similar but starts later because of the upload-tail dependency. Once both ends are post-overlap, `max(upload, download)` is the real wall-clock cost.)

**Emulator-side bytesPerSec anomaly noted in Test #71** — Tecno's `MediaRecorder` writes ~4500 bytes/s for 30-second voice (44 chunks), but the emulator's `MediaRecorder` writes ~2200 bytes/s (22 chunks) at the same OPUS/AAC profile. This is a Android encoder/microphone variance (different VBR behaviour + ambient silence on the emulator audio pipeline), not a chunking bug. The chunker just slices the produced ciphertext at 3200 bytes; if the file is half-sized, chunk count halves.

**Known follow-ups (open, not blocking M2 track):**
1. **PR-M2h** — pooled OkHttp download A/B. After M2f.2 the per-chunk download cost (~1.1 s) is the dominant remaining bottleneck. Hypothesis: each fresh client + fresh TLS handshake pays ~600-800 ms that a pooled connection would amortise. Risk: Tele2 may close pooled HTTP/1.1 connections aggressively (the same class of issue PR-R0.1/R0.3/M1w-R4 mitigated for other endpoints by going fresh-per-call). Therefore A/B with a runtime fallback to fresh-per-call on stall/timeout, not a blind switch.
2. **PR-D1e** — first-message bootstrap fast path. Every test in the M2 trilogy reproduced the same symptom: after adding a new contact, the first text message hangs ~10-20 s with a yellow dot before delivering. Logs pinpoint `PREKEY_TRACE upload_fail SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=8021` on the contact-bootstrap publish. Architect-locked fix: prewarm prekey bundle after contact add, REST-first send for bootstrap in Limited realtime, shorter ACK timeout before REST fallback. Unrelated to media path.
3. **UI stale-bubble track** — receiver `AudioBubble` briefly flashes "Downloading" again after `download_complete` on some Test #70.2 sizes; re-entering the chat refreshes it. A Compose state-refresh issue tracked separately from transport.

**Memory entries.** `project_m2d_roadmap_2026_05_18.md` (multi-PR sequence, now showing M2d.1a/M2d.1b/M2e/M2f/M2f.1/M2f.1b/M2f.2 closed and M2h/D1e/UI as remaining) and `project_m2e_locked_params_2026_05_19.md` (fresh-task window math — kept since the parameters still apply at the receiver level).

### 2026-05-19 (tue) · Voice-delivery acceleration trilogy merged — PR-M2d.1a (#182) + PR-M2d.1b (#183) + PR-M2e (#184)

**Branch state.** Three PRs squash-merged into master back-to-back: `2a9ba08c` (M2d.1a, 204 No Content + idempotency-aware retry), `f804e0d8` (M2d.1b, progress UI for upload/download), `fd53b676` (M2e, early manifest + overlap). All three branches deleted on remote. Visual polish (PR-M2d.1b commit on top of the original skeleton) is part of the same squash. No regressions on text-message path across any of the three real-hardware tests.

**Context.** After PR-M2c.0 rejected bigger chunks on the Helsinki path, the audit's third-architect analysis recommended a different lever: keep the chunk size, fix the things on top of it. Three orthogonal wins were sequenced one PR at a time so each could be reverted independently if it regressed. None did.

**PR-M2d.1a — 204 No Content on upload + idempotency-aware retry.** The 31-second per-chunk gap on Tele2 (visible in Test #62 and confirmed by VPS-side relay logs serving in single-digit ms) was an OkHttp body-read timeout: the relay returned 201 JSON, the response body was small, but Tele2 Layer B dropped it on the way to the phone. The fallback retry then re-uploaded already-stored chunks. Fix: client sends `Prefer: return=minimal` (RFC 7240), relay branches on a `wants_minimal` header check and returns 204 with `X-Chunk-Stored/Duplicate/Idx` headers + `Cache-Control: no-store`. Client reads `statusCode + headersOnlyElapsedMs` BEFORE body read; on 204 there is no body to drop. `bodyReadError` is captured into a separate variable so the legacy-path fallback (`if bodyReadError != null && statusCode in [200, 201]` → success) only fires when the relay actually accepted the chunk — 401/409/413/5xx still propagate as errors. Relay tests: 3 new test cases covering `Prefer` accepted (stored), `Prefer` accepted (duplicate), `Prefer` absent (legacy 201/JSON). Test #67a (5-sec voice + 35-sec voice on Tecno Tele2 → emulator under VPN): all upload responses `status=204 bodyMs=0` (or =1) on Tecno. 5-sec voice: 15 chunks × ~720 ms ≈ 10.8 s upload + 0.9 s manifest = 11.7 s on phone side. 35-sec voice: 105 chunks × ~727 ms = ~77 s upload. The transport-layer bug class (Tele2 body-drop false-timeout) was confirmed closed; the user-visible slow time was now obviously the N sequential `headersMs` round-trips per chunk, which M2d.1a did not address. Architect verdict: PASS for the narrow goal, do not expect this alone to speed up long voice.

**PR-M2d.1b — live N/M progress UI for sender and receiver.** Without a counter the user could not tell whether the long upload/download was alive or hung. Added `MediaProgressBus` (in-memory `StateFlow<Map<String, Progress>>` — zero DB writes, cleared on completion/failure). `VoiceV2Sender.uploadVoice` and `VoiceV2DownloadOrchestrator.runDownloadTask` accept progress callbacks and emit `MEDIA_TX upload_progress sent=N total=M` / `MEDIA_RX download_progress received=N total=M` per chunk. DMS wires callbacks (sender keyed by `localMsgId`, receiver keyed by `mediaId` because the receive-side row PK == mediaId per the M1w handler) and clears the bus in `finally`. `AppContainer` exposes the bus, `ChatScreen.MessageBubble` collects via `collectAsState()` and passes the row's progress entry to `AudioBubble`, which renders `Uploading N/M` (sender) or `Downloading N/M` (receiver) with a live progress bar. Also fixed a UI-side recorder re-entry bug surfaced during Test #67b (after a 5-sec voice finished, a new VOICE_REC config fired 334 ms later — looked like a bounced tap or stray touch event reusing the mic onClick): added a `voiceSendInProgress` Compose state that blocks the mic button until `sendAudio` returns, with `VOICE_REC ignored_start reason=finalizing_or_sending` logged on bounced taps. **Test #67b** caught two bugs: recorder re-entry (closed in 67b.1), and the original M2d.1b condition `status == MessageStatus.UPLOADING && progress != null` was too strict — logs proved the row was being loaded as `status=QUEUED` (the `reloadMessages()` snapshot ran between the DB INSERT and the `updateStatus(UPLOADING)` commit on the sender path), so the upload bubble never lit up on the sender side. **Test #67b.1** dropped the status gate (just `isSent && progress != null && direction == UPLOAD` — the presence of a bus entry IS the live-upload signal) and added a `MEDIA_UI progress_lookup found=true direction=upload sent=N total=M isSent=true status=QUEUED` diagnostic log per recomposition. Test #67b.1 PASS: Vladislav saw `Uploading N/M` on the sender bubble (faint), `Downloading N/M` on the receiver bubble, no recorder re-entry. **Test #67b.2** (visual polish before push) made the sender bubble use `BgDeep` ink on the cyan sent background (was barely visible at `TextDim` alpha 0.65), bumped label to `12.sp / FontWeight.Medium`, thickened the progress bar `3 → 4 dp` with rounded clip, and dimmed the time-row to `BgDeep.copy(alpha=0.65)`. Visual style still considered "raw" by Vladislav but acceptable as a non-blocker — UI/UX polish will be a separate track covering read receipts, presence, bubble layout, failed/retry states (issues that pre-existed M2d.1b). M2d.1b is locked UI/state/progress only — no transport, relay, chunk size, codec, parallelism, or manifest changes.

**PR-M2e — early manifest + overlap upload/download.** Even with the 204 fix and the progress counter, long voice was still slow because the chain was strictly sequential: sender uploads ALL chunks → sender sends manifest → receiver downloads ALL chunks. Total wait ≈ `upload + download`. M2e turns it into two overlapping phases so total wait approaches `max(upload, download)`. `VoiceV2Sender.uploadVoice` now accepts an `onEarlyManifest: suspend (manifest) -> Unit` callback. The manifest is built up front (mediaId / mediaKey / nonce / sha256 are known immediately after `encryptVoice` returns) and the callback fires exactly once after `EARLY_MANIFEST_AFTER_CHUNKS = 3` chunks have committed on the relay (`min(3, total)` for very short voices). DMS hoists the manifest-send block into a `suspend fun sendManifestEnvelope(manifest)` lambda used by both the early callback and a tail fallback, guarded by a local `manifestSent` boolean — guaranteed exactly one `MEDIA_TX manifest_sent` per `mediaId`. `UPLOADING → SENT` flips after manifest leaves the device; the upload tail continues in background and the bubble's `Uploading N/M` keeps ticking until `upload_complete` (the bus entry survives until `finally`, AudioBubble does NOT gate on status). On the receiver, the old `ByteArray?` return type collapsed 404 (chunks-gone) and auth-exhausted (terminal) into the same `null`, which would have caused false `media_chunks_gone` failures on the upload tail under overlap. Added a sealed `ChunkOutcome.Ok / NotReady / Terminal`. The fresh-task window scales with chunk count — `freshWindowMs = (chunkCount × 1500 ms).coerceIn(120_000, 300_000)` — so a 15-chunk voice has 120 s grace and a 200-chunk voice has 300 s (cap). On `NotReady` within the window: log `MEDIA_RX chunk_not_ready_yet idx=N retry_in=Xms ageMs=Y windowMs=Z`, backoff `1s → 2s → 3s` cap, retry the same idx. On `NotReady` past the window: log `chunk_not_ready_deadline_exceeded`, then existing `markFailed(media_chunks_gone)`. `Terminal` outcomes fail immediately. Parameters locked by Vladislav 2026-05-19 after he rejected the original proposal of fixed 60 s + 10 retries × 2 s as too short for 100+-chunk voice (would false-fail the tail on Tele2 LTE). One small post-CI fixup added a separate `MEDIA_TX send_failed_after_early_manifest` log tag for the new edge case where the manifest already left but the tail upload failed, so diagnostics can distinguish it from the legacy pre-manifest failure. **Test #68** smoking gun confirmed end-to-end overlap. Sender 82-chunk voice: `chunk_split chunkCount=82` at 22:44:34 → `upload_progress sent=3 total=82` at 22:44:36 → `early_manifest_sent afterChunks=3 total=82` at 22:44:36 → `manifest_sent` at 22:44:37 → `upload_complete` at 22:45:35. Receiver in the same window (after the 5 h timezone offset): `manifest_acked_and_queued` at 03:44:38 (= sender's 22:44:38) → `fresh_window_ms windowMs=123000` → `download_progress received=1 total=82` at 03:44:38 → `download_complete` at 03:46:08. Receiver started downloading **~57 s before sender finished uploading**. Zero `media_chunks_gone`, zero `download_failed`, zero `decrypt_failed`, zero `sha256_mismatch`, zero `chunk_not_ready_yet` (sender was fast enough that the receiver never overtook upload — the fresh-task path is a safety net, not a hot path in this run). Voice playable on both endpoints. The architect's overall verdict: 82-chunk voice total wait dropped from ~150 s (`upload 60 s + download 90 s`) to ~90 s (`max(upload 60 s, download 90 s)`), roughly a 40 % improvement on long voice. Still subjectively long because per-chunk `~1.1 s` GET RTT on the receiver is the new bottleneck — M2e did not address it.

**Recorder re-entry root cause — separate from the three media PRs but caught during Test #67b.** A 334 ms re-entry pattern in the logcat showed `VOICE_REC complete duration=5600` followed by a fresh `VOICE_REC config` before `sendAudio` could even return. The recorder-stop and recorder-start branches in `ChatScreen.onMicClick` shared an `isRecording` state that was flipped synchronously without protecting against the in-flight stop / send path. The fix is a per-screen `voiceSendInProgress` Compose state that gates the mic button entirely while `sendAudio` is running, with a clear `VOICE_REC ignored_start reason=finalizing_or_sending` log line for diagnostics. The pattern matches the broader "UI-side state guards belong next to send-layer guards" principle used by the D2a/M1w voice gating layer.

**Visual style of the progress row — non-blocking follow-up.** Vladislav and the architect both flagged the original `Uploading N/M` rendering as too faint to read on the cyan sender bubble. The visual polish included in M2d.1b (BgDeep ink on sent, 12 sp + Medium weight, thicker rounded progress bar) improved contrast but the bubble is still considered "raw". This is part of a broader UI/UX debt: read receipts ambiguity, online/presence flakiness, message status icon consistency, message bubble layout, failed/retry visual states, loading animations, and message-row refresh consistency. Vladislav decided this UI work belongs to a separate dedicated track (PR-UI1 series, name TBD) rather than being interleaved with transport/protocol work. Locked: do not block transport progress on UI polish; do not bundle UI polish into transport PRs.

**Yellow-dot first-message delay on text messages — separate follow-up, NOT a regression.** Test #67b/67b.1/67b.2/68 all reproduced the "after adding a contact, first text message shows yellow dot for some seconds before delivering" symptom. Logs across the four tests pinpoint it at the `PREKEY_TRACE upload_fail ... SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=184182` path. This is the same class as the H1/H1e half-open WS / bootstrap-publish failure modes already triaged. It is NOT caused by any of the three media PRs and was already there on master `2a9ba08c`. The architect labelled it as a separate prekey/ACK/bootstrap follow-up; not to be bundled with media PRs.

**Memory entries created.** `project_m2d_roadmap_2026_05_18.md` (locked sequence M2d.1a → M2d.1b → M2e → M2f → M2g), `project_m2e_locked_params_2026_05_19.md` (dynamic fresh-task window math + why fixed 60 s would false-fail).

**Next track.** PR-M2f — binary `application/octet-stream` `/media/v3/{mediaId}/{idx}` endpoint as the next real speed-step. Removes JSON + Base64 overhead (~33 % of wire body) so a `~1700 byte raw ciphertext` chunk turns into `1700 bytes on wire` instead of `~2388 body bytes`. On the Tele2 LTE full-roundtrip ceiling of ~2400 bytes, this gives headroom to raise raw ciphertext per chunk from ~1700 to ~2200-2300 (~25-35 % fewer chunks → 82 chunks → ~60-65 chunks for the same 35-sec voice). Will ship as an A/B endpoint alongside the existing JSON path so a single PR can be reverted cleanly if the binary path regresses on any device. After M2f probe data lands, PR-M2g (HTTP Range / 206 Partial Content download) becomes conditional — only if M2f shows the asymmetric pattern "large upload OK, small downloads OK".

### 2026-05-18 (mon, evening) · PR-M2c.0 cap probe complete — bigger chunks blocked on Tele2 Helsinki path, next track is route diversity

**Branch state.** PR #176 (M2b parallelism) stays closed/parked (revert merged 2026-05-18 as #178). PR #179 (relay media body cap is config-driven) merged to master as `c05f4127`. No further code shipped to master in this session beyond the relay fix. Probe-side Android changes preserved on retained branch `diag/m2c0-media-route-probe` for future Romania-path re-run.

**Investigation path.** Test #66 ran the original probe and got `413 outcome=relay_too_large` for every body size ≥ 5500. Architect read it as "Tele2 not letting us through", but a code trace found two cap-enforcement layers in the relay: the in-handler check (config-driven via `RELAY_MAX_MEDIA_UPLOAD_BODY_BYTES`) and the axum `DefaultBodyLimit` middleware (hard-coded to the `MAX_MEDIA_UPLOAD_BODY_BYTES = 3072` constant at `services/relay/src/routes.rs:96`). The env-var override only lifted the in-handler check; the middleware still rejected anything > 3072. PR #179 routes both layers through `state.config.max_media_upload_body_bytes`, and ships two new tests (`test_http_body_limit_respects_config_override`, `test_http_body_limit_fires_above_config_override`) that catch any future regression of the same kind. VPS deploy with `--build` confirmed the fix: a smoke `curl` of a 5400-byte POST returned 401 (auth) instead of 413 (cap).

**Test #66.1** (probe v1 after the fix) lifted the 413 wall but exposed a probe-code bug: the same line could read `status=201 outcome=stored elapsedMs=15008 error=InterruptedIOException:timeout`. Architect-debriefed: status was captured before the body read, then `response.body?.string()` timed out at the OkHttp read-timeout, and the probe didn't distinguish "relay-side success but Tele2 dropped the response body" from "relay-side failure". Probe was rewritten as v2.1 with non-overlapping outcome enums (`STORED` / `DUPLICATE` / `STORED_RESPONSE_DROPPED` / `RELAY_TOO_LARGE` / `AUTH_FAIL` / `BAD_REQUEST` / `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` / `OTHER_HTTP` / `FAIL_EXCEPTION` for upload; `OK` / `SHA_MISMATCH` / `BODY_READ_FAILED` / `NOT_FOUND` / `AUTH_FAIL` / `OTHER_HTTP` / `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` / `SKIPPED` for download), a 2400-byte control row (current production wire size — sanity-checks the probe decoder + tells us whether Tele2 Layer B already bites at production size), and explicit SHA-256 hex prefixes in each result line for cross-referencing with relay logs. Final-verdict logic was switched from `largestStoredSafe` (upload-only) to `largestFullRoundtrip` (upload AND download) as the architect insisted: shipping a chunk size the receiver cannot download is the actual Test #62-#65 failure mode.

**Test #66.2 result** (probe v2.1):

| Body | relayStored | fullRoundtrip | upload avg ms | download avg ms | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2400 (control) | 3/3 | **3/3** | 725 | 733 | stable_full |
| 5500 | 5/5 | 0/5 | ~15 000 | n/a | stored_but_resp_dropped |
| 6500 | 5/5 | 0/5 | ~15 000 | n/a | stored_but_resp_dropped |
| 7168 | 0/3 | 0/3 | timeout | n/a | unstable |

**M2C0_FINAL on Helsinki:** `stableMaxBodyFullRoundtrip=2400 largestUploadOnly=6500 recommendedRawChunkBytes=1700`.

**Locked decision.** Do not ship PR-M2c bigger chunks on the Helsinki path. Production `TARGET_RAW_CHUNK_BYTES` stays at 1700. The Tele2 LTE middlebox cleanly accepts requests up to ~6500 bytes (relay log proves chunks land), but reliably drops the 201-response body on upload and the GET-body on download for sizes > ~2400. Increasing chunk size would speed up senders but break receiver downloads. The audit document `docs/design/voice-delivery-audit-2026-05-18.md` Section 8 captures the data and the rejection.

**Next track: PR-INFRA-MediaRO.** Deploy a second `phantom-relay` (full binary, not bridge) at a different VPS/ASN (FlokiNET Romania candidate — bridge2 deployment exists as a reference). Allocate `media-ro.phntm.pro` (or similar). Decide auth model (federated identity vs per-relay registry). Re-run the probe with two `MediaProbeEndpoint` entries. If Romania gives `fullRoundtrip 5/5` at 5500 or 6500, design `mediaRelayId` extension to `VoiceManifestV2` and route media via the better path per-voice. Probe code retained on `diag/m2c0-media-route-probe` so the Romania re-run is one-config-edit-and-rebuild away, not a fresh probe rewrite.

**Architectural insight preserved as memory entry** (`feedback_tele2_media_path_ceiling_2026_05_18.md`): for the current single-relay `relay.phntm.pro` deployment, Tele2 LTE full-roundtrip ceiling on `/media/upload-chunk` + `/media/chunk/.../...` is approximately 2400 bytes wire body. Upload-only ceiling is ~6500 bytes (sender pushes successfully, but Tele2 drops the response on the way back, and the same path drops GET responses on download). Any future attempt to raise chunk size on this single endpoint will hit the same ceiling; the lever is route diversity, not chunk size, codec, parallelism, or in-handler cap.

### 2026-05-18 (mon, late) · PR-M2a merged — voice-note recorder profile shrinks 5-sec voice ~40 % (`bc94a4d4` on master)

**Branch state.** PR #174 squash-merged to master as `bc94a4d4`. Single commit on top of M1w. Branch deleted on remote.

**Scope.** Voice-note recorder profile only. No transport, manifest, crypto, DI, or parallelism changes. Both `ChatScreen.startChatRecording` and `GroupChatScreen.startGroupRecording` move from music-grade to voice-grade encoder settings:

| | Before (M1w) | After (M2a) |
|---|---|---|
| OPUS path (API 29+) | 48 kHz / mono / 48 kbps | 16 kHz / mono / 24 kbps |
| Fallback path (API 26-28) | AAC @ 44.1 kHz / 64 kbps | AAC_ELD @ 16 kHz / 24 kbps |
| Container | OGG / MPEG_4 | OGG / MPEG_4 (unchanged) |
| MIME | audio/ogg / audio/m4a | unchanged |
| 5-sec voice (measured Test #62) | 39-57 KB | 23.5 KB |
| 35-sec voice (measured Test #62) | ~270-400 KB est. | 150 KB / 89 chunks |

AAC_ELD (Enhanced Low Delay AAC) is the Android voice profile available since API 16, so safe at our minSdk=26. OPUS guard `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= VERSION_CODES.Q` stays exactly as before. Channels stay mono (intentional — speech is mono and the same bitrate sounds cleaner than stereo).

**Diagnostic logs added** (Test #62/63+ grep targets):
- `VOICE_REC config encoder=OPUS|AAC_ELD sampleRate=16000 bitrate=24000 channels=1 outputFormat=OGG|MPEG_4 mime=audio/...` (emitted before MediaRecorder.start() to confirm the recorder applied the chosen profile rather than silently defaulting). The group recorder log appends `scope=group` to distinguish.
- `VOICE_REC complete durationMs=... bytes=... bytesPerSec=... mime=...` (emitted at the call site after stop() to surface the real-world payload; `bytesPerSec` is integer-math with explicit `durationMs > 0` guard).

**MIME mapping fix.** `VoiceFileStore.mimeToExtension` now matches `audio/m4a` (what the AAC-fallback sender sets) in addition to the IANA-canonical `audio/mp4`. Before the fix the AAC-fallback receive path landed on a generic `audio` extension; MediaPlayer auto-detected from content so playback worked, but the file extension was misleading.

**Test #62 verdict.** Codec change applied and works end-to-end. 5-sec voice fell from 39-57 KB to 23.5 KB (~40-60 % reduction). 35-sec voice fell from ~270-400 KB estimate to 150 KB / 89 chunks. The architect-suggested M2a.1 follow-up (drop bitrate further 24 → 16 kbps to hit the strict ≤ 20 KB target) was prepared as commit `3a2689fc` and then **vetoed by Vladislav** ("нам надо, чтобы звук был идеальным, почти в HD") — the commit was reset on the feature branch with `git push --force-with-lease` before CI re-fired, and the PR shipped as the 24 kbps profile. The architectural call: quality > size for Phantom's premium-feel positioning. Size optimisation continues at the transport layer (PR-M2b) not the codec layer. The voice-quality preference is logged in agent memory as `feedback_voice_quality_priority.md` — 24 kbps is the floor, 16 kbps gated as a future "Data Saver" toggle.

**Out of scope, queued for next sessions.**
- PR-M2b — download parallelism = 2 (receiver UX; lowest-risk concurrency win on Tele2).
- PR-M2c — upload parallelism = 2 (only after M2b proven stable).
- PR-M2d — optional batch endpoint (`GET /media/chunks?from=N&count=4`), carefully because large POST bodies on Tele2 have given trouble before.

### 2026-05-18 (mon) · PR-M1w merged — encrypted media-upload voice messages live for 1:1 chats (`561de17c` on master, 7 commits squashed)

**Branch state.** PR #172 squash-merged to master as `561de17c`. Closes the long road from "voice = 150 ratchet envelopes ≈ 2 min on Tele2" (Test #55) to "voice = encrypted media upload + manifest envelope, end-to-end functional on Tele2 LTE" (Test #61). Branch `feat/pr-m1w-voice-upload` deleted on remote.

**Commits squashed into `561de17c`** (in order):
- 5 builder commits — M1 core (storage schema, sender/orchestrator, DMS handlers, UI bubbles). Effectively inert until integration.
- `53253d6d` — fix-blockers MB1-MB5 from initial security + architect review (sha256 decode fail-closed, MediaAuthException class semantics, markFailed signature simplification, test assertion fix, SQLDelight CREATE TABLE for CI).
- `40e98bb7` — CI-driven hidden-compile fixes (kotlinx-datetime out of storage module, opaque generated row class avoided via inline mapping, removed cross-module commonTest fakes).
- `115b442b` — **live wire-up** caught by Test #56: AppContainer never constructed `VoiceV2Sender` / `VoiceV2DownloadRepository` / `VoiceV2DownloadOrchestrator` (the previous security review's "P8 — AppContainer DI complete with lines 738-740 wiring all three" was a hallucination — `git log -- AppContainer.kt` showed last touch was PR-C1). This commit also flips `TransportCapabilitiesResolver.canSendVoice = true` for `RestActive` + `WsCandidate` (calls stay false in Limited realtime).
- `cc456a36` — MB6 + MB7 (Test #57): sender wraps `VoiceManifestV2` in `MessagePayload(type=TYPE_VOICE_V2)` so receiver's branch fires; `KtorMediaUploadTransport` wraps `SocketTimeoutException` as `MediaTransportException` so `VoiceV2Sender` retry loop fires.
- `9ef4a76e` — R4 (Test #58): `AndroidNativeOkHttpMediaUploadTransport` mirrors the locked R0.1/R0.3 pattern (HTTP/1.1 only, fresh client per call, `ConnectionPool(0)`, `retryOnConnectionFailure(false)`, `Connection: close`, 10 s timeouts); `sendAudioV2` Steps 4-7 wrapped in `scope.launch` so the upload survives Compose lifecycle changes. Closed the ~31 s per-chunk Tele2 stall the architect verified via VPS logs (relay served chunks in milliseconds; phone Ktor client waited a full timeout between GETs).
- `47a1b038` — R5 (Test #59): `runVoiceV2DownloadTask` re-reads the row and emits `IncomingMessage` after `download_complete` so `ChatScreen` transitions `[AUDIO_DOWNLOADING]` → playable voice without exit+reentry; `handleVoiceV2Manifest` threads `payload.senderUsername` so notification title shows the contact name not raw hex; sender row flips `UPLOADING → SENT` immediately after `manifest_sent` instead of waiting on ack flow. New logs: `MEDIA_RX message_ready`, `MEDIA_TX local_status_sent`.
- `0a48c8cf` — R6.1 (Test #60): `handleVoiceV2Manifest` upserts conversation with `unreadCount + 1` and preview `🎤 Voice message` so the Chats list shows the unread badge the moment the manifest arrives.

**Tests run on real hardware** (Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on Tele2 LTE Иркутская + `emulator-5554`):

| # | Failure surface | Fix landed |
|---|---|---|
| #56 | `MEDIA_RX no_download_repo` at startup; emulator sent legacy `audio_chunk`; Tecno blocked by C1 gate | DI wire-up + capability flip (`115b442b`) |
| #57 | Receiver decoded manifest as `MessagePayload(type=message, text="")` → empty chat bubble + envelope-id in notification | Manifest wrapper (`cc456a36`) |
| #58 | Phone download = 1 chunk / ~31 s on Tele2 LTE; phone upload died on Compose scope cancel | Native OkHttp + DMS scope (`9ef4a76e`) |
| #59 | Receiver bubble stuck on `[AUDIO_DOWNLOADING]` despite download_complete; sender bubble stuck on UPLOADING; notification showed raw hex | UI emit + sender label + status flip (`47a1b038`) |
| #60 | Chats list never showed unread badge for incoming voice | `unreadCount + 1` upsert (`0a48c8cf`) |
| #61 | — PASS — | (no fix needed) |

**Architect verdict on Test #61.** "Test #61 = PASS. PR #172 ready to merge." All five functional gates green: voice delivery, native media transport, AUDIO_LOCAL transition, unread badge, notification title.

**Known follow-up: PR-M2 performance pass.** Test #60 showed 5-sec voice = 39-57 KB and current sequential one-HTTP-RTT-per-chunk throughput would make 1-5 min voice take minutes to upload/download. Three M2 tracks queued:
- **M2a** — recorder bitrate / voice-note profile (mono Opus / AAC at 16-32 kbps; 5 sec voice ≈ 10-20 KB).
- **M2b** — download parallelism = 2 (receiver-side; lowest-risk concurrency win).
- **M2c** — upload parallelism = 2 or adaptive (only after Tele2 stability proven for M2b).
- **M2d** — optional batch endpoint (`GET /media/chunks?from=N&count=4`); later, carefully — large POST bodies on Tele2 have given trouble before.

**Lesson logged: reviewer hallucination on DI claims.** Test #56 caught a fabricated positive finding from the security-reviewer agent and a matching fabrication in the builder agent's commit-5 summary. Both claimed "AppContainer wired with `voiceV2Sender / Repository / Orchestrator` at lines 738-740" — `git log -- AppContainer.kt` proved the file was last touched in PR-C1, with no M1w changes at all. The runtime `MEDIA_RX no_download_repo` log line emitted by DMS init was the source of truth. Memory entry `feedback_reviewer_hallucination_2026_05_18.md` codifies the rule: any reviewer claim of "wired" / "integrated" / "passed" with specific line numbers requires `git log -p` + `grep` proof before trust. The third instance of "Ktor / persistent HTTP on Tele2 stalls; replace with native OkHttp fresh client per call" (after R0.1 and R0.3) is also logged as `project_tele2_media_path_2026_05_18.md`.

**Voice on Limited realtime is now production-functional**: voice records, encrypts, uploads chunks via native OkHttp + manifest envelope via ratchet, receiver downloads + decrypts + verifies sha256 + writes to `filesDir/voice/<mediaId>.<ext>`, chats list shows unread badge, notification shows contact name, bubble transitions to playable. The pre-existing audio_chunk path remains in code as the JVM/test fallback and for any in-flight Alpha-1 messages but is no longer the production sender path.

### 2026-05-17 (sun) · PR-D2b.2 + D2b.3a probe parked as proof-of-concept — Test #54/#55 surface real cost: 5-sec voice = 150 chunks × 700 ms ≈ 2 min on Tele2 REST; architect-recommended pivot to PR-M1 (encrypted media upload) + PR-C1 (calls capability gating)

**Branch state.** Draft PR #166 on `feat/pr-d2b2-flip-canSendVoice-and-15s-cap` holds two commits, NOT merged:
- `89f1bf0c` — PR-D2b.2: `canSendVoice = (WsActive || RestActive || WsCandidate)`, `canStartCalls = WsActive only`; removed D2a voice UI guard in `ChatScreen.onMicClick`; kept call UI guard in `onVoiceCall`; added `VOICE_RECORDER_MAX_DURATION_MS = 15_000L` auto-stop that reuses manual-stop pipeline via local `stopAndSendRecording` val; logs `VOICE_TX recorder_auto_stop`.
- `89298f37` — PR-D2b.3a probe: `AUDIO_CHUNK_BYTES = 3072 → 256` (temporary diagnostic), 8-field `VOICE_TX size_probe` log (rawBytes/jsonEncoded/padded/paddedB64/bodyBytes etc.), `sendAudio` failure path stamps `MessageStatus.FAILED` on `chunk_send_fail`. Test renamed `sendAudio_returnsFailureAndStampsRowFailed_whenChunkSendRejected`.

**Test #54 (chunk=3072).** `send_oversize`: rawBytes=3072 → REST bodyBytes ≈ 22 288 → REST cap `max_send_body=4096` rejected every chunk. Confirmed: 6.5× JSON-int-array bloat on ratchet `EncryptedMessage` ByteArray serialization is the root multiplier. Architect recommended size-probe instead of blind retune.

**Test #55 (chunk=256).** Probe = PASS at envelope level: rawBytes=256 → bodyBytes ≈ 3672–3856 < 4096, status=201, `chunk_send_ok`. Durable receiver path also confirmed live (`VOICE_RX chunk_received → chunk_decode_ok → chunk_saved source=durable → ack_deliver_send`, `assembly_waiting received=N/total`). End-to-end = FAIL: 38 KB voice / 256 B = **150 chunks × ~700–800 ms = ~100–120 s upload**, UX-unacceptable; user sent a second voice before first completed, creating overlapping 150+166-chunk streams, no `assembly_complete` reached, no UI voice message appeared (intentional — no partial placeholder in v1). On chat re-entry two local outgoing voice rows surfaced — UX bug, not transport bug.

**Architect verdict (2026-05-17).** "Я бы остановил текущую ветку D2b.2/D2b.3 как 'proof-of-concept, не product-ready' и стартовал новый design: PR-M1 — encrypted media upload for voice messages. А для звонков отдельно: PR-C1 — call capability gating + realtime probe design." Reasoning: voice = async store-and-forward media; calls = realtime stream; both share a common Media Core (codec/Opus, mediaKey, chunks, upload/download, manifest, progress, retry/resume) but are distinct transports. Sending voice as 150 ratchet envelopes is structurally wrong for UX even if each envelope succeeds.

**Open paths (no "go" yet from Vladislav).**
- **A.** Park PR #166 as proof-of-concept; start PR-M1 (encrypted media upload — record → mediaKey → encrypt locally → upload encrypted chunks via REST media endpoint with idempotency → send small E2E voice manifest `{voiceId, mediaKey, duration, mime, chunkCount, sha256}` → receiver GETs + decrypts + inserts one voice row). Tele2 constraints: upload body ~1500–2000 B, tiny responses, GET for download (Tele2 small-GET is reliable per 2026-05-16 diagnostic Layer B).
- **B.** Stopgap PR-D2b.3b (compact `EncryptedMessage` serialization: ByteArray → base64 string vs JSON int-arrays) → ~5× shrink → ~38 chunks per 38 KB voice instead of 150, plus in-progress guard (`voiceSendInProgress(conversationId)` → block second voice + log `VOICE_TX blocked_send_in_progress`), uploading-state UI, replace misleading "voice too long" copy. Faster to ship but still ratchet-envelope architecture.
- **C.** PR-C1 in parallel (TransportCapabilities: Limited realtime → calls disabled, Stable realtime → enabled, Tor/REST-only → disabled) + realistic realtime probe (open channel, send upstream frame, receive downstream ack, hold 10–20 s, measure RTT/jitter/loss) — replaces current `/health` proxy. C2 = Reality endpoint pool (multi IP/ASN/SNI/port), C3 = WebRTC+TURN-TLS vs custom Opus-over-Reality.

**Decision locked 2026-05-17 evening — A + C параллельно** (Vladislav + architect aligned).
- **B (compact serialization PR-D2b.3b) rejected.** Architect quote: "Compact serialization даст ускорение, но всё равно останется старая архитектура: голосовое = много ratchet envelopes. Даже если 150 chunks превратятся в 38 chunks, это всё ещё десятки отдельных сообщений, десятки ACK, десятки retry, сложный UX и задержка. Это стопгап, а не продуктовый путь."
- **PR #166 parked, не merge.** D2b.1 остаётся в master как foundation / fallback / research result.
- **PR-M1 contract LOCKED (architect apply 2026-05-17 evening).** Split into 3 PRs:
  - **M1r** — relay: `POST /media/upload-chunk` + `GET /media/chunk/{mediaId}/{idx}`, bearer-session auth, hard cap 3072 bytes (client target ≤2600), idempotency by `(media_id, idx, ciphertext_hash)`, in-memory `media_chunks` store, TTL=7d + sweeper, quotas `maxMediaChunks=256` / `maxMediaBytes=1MB`, no DELETE in round 1. `mediaId = base64url(random 32 bytes)` capability token.
  - **M1k** — Kotlin `MediaUploadTransport` + manifest model + XChaCha20-Poly1305 (AAD=mediaId), inert/not wired. Manifest `{type:"voice_v2", mediaId, mediaKey, nonce, alg:"xchacha20poly1305-v1", durationMs, mime, chunkCount, encryptedSizeBytes, plainSizeBytes, sha256(plaintext)}`.
  - **M1w** — wire `sendAudio` to M1 (upload all chunks → THEN send single manifest via `/relay/send`); receiver on `voice_v2` GETs chunks, reassembles, decrypts+verifies, inserts one voice row. D2b legacy parked.
  - Sequential upload, single voice at a time, 1:1 only.
  - Throughput: ~22–25 chunks vs current 150 → ~12–20 s on Tele2 (still REST-bound, not instant).
- **PR-C1 — calls capability gating (parallel track).** Small scope: `Stable realtime → calls enabled`, `Limited realtime / REST / Tor / Reality-without-realtime-proof → calls disabled`. Call button allowed only when `realtimeStable == true`. Voice in Limited realtime ALSO gated until M1w wires the new media-upload path (avoiding D2b regression). Two-layer guard: UI Snackbar + `CallManager.startCall` early return with `CALL_TX blocked_*` log. Full RealtimeProbe (upstream frame + downstream ack + 10–20 s hold + RTT/jitter/loss) lands later in C2/C3.
- **Goal.** Voice = async encrypted media (not ratchet envelopes); calls blocked until stable realtime transport exists.

**Execution complete 2026-05-17 same evening.**
- PR #169 M1k merged `14:37Z` after security-aware fixup (ionspin API names + MediaCryptoTest moved to `androidInstrumentedTest` + KDoc unclosed-comment fix + token: String threaded through `MediaUploadTransport`/`KtorMediaUploadTransport` with `Authorization: Bearer $token` header + 2 new header-assert tests). 12/12 unit tests green, 9 instrumented tests deferred to M1w preflight.
- PR #170 C1 merged `15:14Z` after architect catch on stale "voice allowed in Limited realtime" (Resolver flipped to `canSendVoice=false` for `WsCandidate`/`RestActive` until M1w; KDoc + onMicClick comment refreshed). 32 resolver tests + 4 `CallManagerGuardTest` tests green, `assembleDebug` green. Defence-in-depth: UI `CALL_CAPABILITY disabled source=ui` + CallManager `CALL_TX blocked_<reason> source=call_manager`. Unified Limited-realtime Snackbar copy locked by architect.
- PR #168 M1r merged `15:19Z` after security-reviewer pass closed 2 blockers (B1 total_mismatch enforcement, B2 route-level `DefaultBodyLimit::max(3072)`) + 5 non-blockers (sweeper lock scope, in-memory durability honesty, unused idempotency_key field removed, per-identity rate-limit TODO, conflict test asserts original ciphertext preserved). 11/11 endpoint tests green.
- **VPS deploy `15:21Z`**: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --build relay` rebuilt + restarted cleanly on `relay.phntm.pro`. `phantom-relay starting host=0.0.0.0 port=8080 max_payload_kb=1024` confirmed in logs.
- **M1r smoke gate PASSED (limited scope) `15:24Z`** — happy-path (201/200/409) deferred to M1w because `/auth/session` Ed25519 challenge isn't shellable. Verified live:
  - `POST /media/upload-chunk` without/with invalid bearer → 401 + `{"error":"Authorization: Bearer <token> required"}` (route alive, auth middleware works).
  - `GET /media/chunk/anychunk/0` without/with invalid bearer → 401 same shape (GET route alive, same auth middleware).
  - **B2 route-level body limit VERIFIED LIVE**: 60 KB POST body → `HTTP/2 413 "Failed to buffer the request"` (HTTP framing layer rejects before handler allocation — the exact DoS-amplification fix the security reviewer flagged).
  - Relay logs clean: 2 startup lines, zero panics, zero SQLite errors, zero `mediaKey`/`ciphertext_b64=...`/full-mediaId leaks.

**Open follow-ups for M1w (preflight before live wire-up).**
- Run `:shared:core:crypto:connectedDebugAndroidTest` on Tecno or emulator to validate the 9 `MediaCryptoTest` cases against the real libsodium native binding (XChaCha20-Poly1305 round-trip + wrong mediaId/key/ciphertext failures + sha256 + mediaId uniqueness).
- M1w design pass: integrate `MediaCrypto` + `MediaChunker` + `KtorMediaUploadTransport` (token-aware) into `DefaultMessagingService.sendAudio`; receiver-side `voice_v2` manifest handler that GETs chunks, reassembles, decrypts, inserts one voice row; flip `Resolver.canSendVoice = true` for `WsCandidate`/`RestActive` once the new path is live. Old `audio_chunk` envelope path parked but kept for backward compat with in-flight messages.

**Source-of-truth artefacts.** Architect transcripts in `C:\Users\felix\OneDrive\Рабочий стол\messages.txt` (Test #55 narrative + Q&A on speed + Q&A on calls-first). Test logs `test55-tecno.log` / `test55-emu.log` already captured. APK still `apps/android/build/outputs/apk/debug/android-debug.apk`.

### 2026-05-17 (sat late night) · PR-D2b.1 merged — durable voice chunk core + sender hardening (still gated by D2a)

**Goal.** Once PR-D2a closed the UX gap on voice/calls in Limited realtime (Test #53 → #53.2 PASS), the next layer is the real fix for voice over REST short-poll: keep the existing chunk-first/encrypt-each architecture from PR #32 (2026-05-04), but make it production-ready on Tele2 LTE. Split D2b into two PRs per architect review: **D2b.1** = durable chunk core + sender hardening; voice on Limited realtime stays gated by D2a until **D2b.2** flips the gate.

**Scope locked with Vladislav + architect 2026-05-17.** Chunk first → encrypt each chunk separately. Each chunk is a stable-envelope-id send. Receiver saves chunk to SQLDelight BEFORE ack-deliver. ACK only after `chunk_saved`. UI inserts exactly one voice message after assembly_complete (no partial placeholder for v1). Partial chunks TTL = 24 h. No partial-placeholder UI. Group voice stays on the in-memory path because the durable schema has no `groupId` column — group durability queued as a separate follow-up PR.

**Implementation (PR #164 → squash `9f1f346b`).** Round 1 (foundation) + round 2 (architect blocker fixes) squashed together:

- **Sender hardening.** `AUDIO_CHUNK_BYTES = 8 KB → 3 KB` so every envelope passes the REST `max_send_body=4096` cap (Test #53.1 emulator log captured the real oversize case `migrate_pending_skip_oversize bodyBytes=7608`). Per-chunk `transport.send()` result check + `VOICE_TX chunk_prepare voiceId=… idx=K/N rawBytes=… envelopeBytes=… envelopeId=…` log + `VOICE_TX chunk_send_fail` + `VOICE_TX chunk_send_ok` instrumentation; on `false` the loop throws so the local message stays `MessageStatus.QUEUED` instead of falsely flipping to `SENT`. Group voice gets the smaller chunks too (accepted side effect — `DefaultGroupMessagingService` references the same constant).
- **Durable receive (new `voice_chunks` table).** Schema migration `16.sqm` (v16 → v17): `PRIMARY KEY (voice_id, idx)` + chunk_bytes blob + total + conversation_id + sender_pubkey_hex + mime_type + duration_ms + updated_at_ms. `VoiceChunkRepository` interface + `SqlDelightVoiceChunkRepository` production impl + `Dispatchers.IO` per call. The 1:1 chunk handler saves chunk → `chunk_saved` → ack-deliver → `countChunks` → if `== total` → `assembleAndDispatch1to1Voice(origin = "live")`. `assembleAndDispatch1to1Voice` concatenates `findOrderedChunks` into one blob, inserts a message keyed on `voiceId` (so live + finalizer paths converge — `INSERT OR IGNORE` makes them idempotent), upserts conversation, emits `_incomingMessages`, fires notification, then `deleteByVoiceId`. If `insertMessage` itself fails, chunks are NOT deleted; finalizer retries on next startup.
- **Startup finalizer.** New pass at the top of `startReceiving` runs `findVoicesReadyToAssemble` and resumes voices whose chunks landed before the previous process death. Same `assembleAndDispatch1to1Voice` helper, `origin = "finalizer"`. Idempotent across both paths via `messages.id = voiceId` + `INSERT OR IGNORE`.
- **24 h TTL with observable eviction.** `VOICE_CHUNK_TTL_MS = 24 h`. Sweep runs opportunistically on every chunk insert AND at `startReceiving`. Each evicted voice emits one `VOICE_RX partial_expired voiceId=… received=K/N ageMs=…` WARN log so the eviction is observable in logcat.
- **Round-2 fix — Blocker 1: already-inserted skip.** Pre-check at the very top of `assembleAndDispatch1to1Voice` calls `messageRepository.getMessageById(voiceId)` and short-circuits to `deleteByVoiceId` with a `VOICE_RX already_inserted_cleanup` log when the row exists. Closes the crash window between live insert and previous `deleteByVoiceId`: pre-fix the finalizer would treat the `INSERT OR IGNORE` no-op as success and proceed to re-bump unread, re-emit `_incomingMessages`, re-fire the notification.
- **Round-2 fix — Blocker 2: `deleteOlderThan` whole-voice semantics.** SQL rewritten to drop every chunk of any voice whose `MIN(updated_at_ms) < cutoff_ms`, matching the `findExpiredSummaries` predicate exactly. Pre-fix row-level `WHERE updated_at_ms < cutoff` left mixed-age voices in a permanently-unassemblable state — fresh chunks at some indices, expired chunks at others, count never reaches total. Both `FakeVoiceChunkRepository` (storage contract test) and `FakeVoiceChunkLedger` (messaging test) updated to mirror the SQL.
- **Round-2 hardening — range guard.** Lives before the durable/in-memory branch: `if (chunkTotal <= 0 || chunkIndex !in 0 until chunkTotal)` → `VOICE_RX chunk_invalid_range` WARN + ack-deliver + return. Rejects payloads where `audioChunkIndex >= audioChunkTotal` so they cannot pollute reassembly state on either path.
- **Backward compat.** Constructor param `voiceChunkRepository: VoiceChunkRepository? = null` defaults to null so existing tests that didn't wire storage fall through to the legacy in-memory path unchanged. Group voice always stays on the in-memory path (no durable `groupId` column yet). Outdated comments in `DefaultMessagingService.kt` ("8 KB → ~53 KB on wire") and `MessagePayload.kt` ("64 KB slices") rewritten to match the actual constants + current semantics.

**Tests (10 storage + 5 messaging).**

- `VoiceChunkRepositoryContractTest` (storage): insert, count, ordered, INSERT OR REPLACE idempotency, find-ready-set, find-expired-summaries, **delete-older-than expired-voices (single-chunk)**, **delete-older-than whole-voice-when-any-chunk-expired (round 2, mixed-age regression)**, delete-by-voice-id, delete-all, ready-voice metadata roundtrip.
- `DefaultMessagingServiceTest` (messaging): `sendAudio_returnsFailureAndKeepsMessageQueued_whenChunkSendRejected` (per-chunk send-result check propagates failure, row stays QUEUED, `transport.send` aborted on first false); `startReceiving_finalizer_assemblesReadyVoice_andDeletesChunks` (2/2 saved chunks become one assembled `[AUDIO:base64]` row); `startReceiving_finalizer_leavesIncompleteVoiceUntouched` (1/3 partial chunks stay in repo, no message row); `startReceiving_finalizer_evictsChunksOlderThanTtl` (25-hour-old voice dropped without insert); **`startReceiving_finalizer_skipsAlreadyInsertedVoice_andCleansUpChunks` (round 2, crash-window regression: pre-seeded msg row + complete chunks → finalizer dedupes via getMessageById, single row, no double-bump, partial freed)**.

**Status after merge.**

- ✅ Voice chunks now survive process death between save and assembly.
- ✅ `transport.send` rejection on any chunk no longer hides behind a falsely-SENT local message.
- ✅ Receiver path emits `VOICE_RX chunk_saved` BEFORE `ack_send_after_handler` on the durable branch — observable order matches the contract.
- ✅ 24 h TTL with per-voice `partial_expired` log; whole-voice eviction guarantees no orphan rows.
- ✅ Finalizer is idempotent across crash + restart; already-inserted voices are cleanly cleaned up without UX duplication.
- ⛔️ Voice on Limited realtime is **still gated closed by D2a's `canSendVoice` lambda** (`mode == WsActive`). The durable path is wired but never exercised in production until D2b.2 flips the gate. This is intentional — the gate flip ships with the recorder cap + real-device acceptance test in one PR so we don't widen the surface area while still validating it.

**What this does NOT do.**

- Does **not** flip `canSendVoice` or remove the `onMicClick` UI guard. That's D2b.2.
- Does **not** add the 15-sec recorder cap. D2b.2.
- Does **not** make group voice durable. Group voice keeps the in-memory 5-minute buffer until a separate PR adds `groupId` to `voice_chunks`.
- Does **not** address the H2b residual risk window between `processedEnvelopeRepository.markProcessed` (inside decrypt mutex) and `voiceChunkRepository.insertChunk`. A crash in that window lets the ledger skip the relay's redelivery and the chunk is lost. Closing it requires receive-pipeline transaction redesign (separate "decrypt ledger" state from "payload persisted" state) — queued as a future PR. The commit + PR body deliberately phrase D2b.1's guarantee as "chunks durable BEFORE ack-deliver after the handler starts to persist them", not "zero-loss between decrypt and save".

**Key commits / PRs.**

- PR #164 (squash-merged as `9f1f346b`) — `feat(media): PR-D2b.1 — durable voice chunk core + sender hardening`. Folds round-1 (`06531596`) + round-2 (`a8849260`).

**Next.**

- **PR-D2b.2 (next session).** Flip `canSendVoice` to allow `RestActive` / `WsCandidate`. Keep `canStartCalls` `WsActive`-only (REST cannot carry WebRTC). Drop voice UI guard in `ChatScreen.onMicClick`, keep call UI guard in `onVoiceCall`. Add 15-sec recorder cap + `VOICE_TX recorder_auto_stop reason=max_duration durationMs=15000` log. Build APK + deliver Test #54 install commands.
- **Test #54.** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on Tele2 LTE Иркутская + emulator-5554. Verify: phone → emu and emu → phone 5–10 sec voice arrives; every chunk `envelopeBytes <= 4096`; `VOICE_RX chunk_saved` precedes `ack_send_after_handler`; `assembly_complete` fires exactly once per voiceId; one voice message in UI (not N chunk messages); killing receiver mid-transfer doesn't corrupt chat (chunks resume on restart or expire silently at 24 h); calls remain blocked.

### 2026-05-17 (sat) · Test #52 PASS — PR-D1d merged, fast active-outbound ACK deadline closes the ~40 s WS→REST latency gap on Tele2 LTE
follow-ups** in compact form. Cross-reference the Decision log above
when an entry mentions a rejected approach.

### 2026-05-17 (sat night) · PR-D2a merged — UX guard for voice/calls on Limited realtime + EN-only Snackbar (Test #53 → #53.1 → #53.2 PASS)

**Goal.** Once PR-D1d closed the ~40 s text-message latency on Tele2
LTE, the next user-visible failure mode was voice messages and calls
silently dying on `RestActive`: REST short-poll caps the body at
4096 bytes, an `audio_chunk` envelope is 11–55 KB, and WebRTC cannot
work over a poll loop at all. The temporary fix — gate both features
at the UI and at the send/call layer when the orchestrator is not
in `WsActive`, with a clear English Snackbar — buys the real fix
(PR-D2b voice-over-REST chunking, plus the separate C-track for
calls) room to land without leaving the user staring at a recorder
that never sends or a call screen that never rings.

**Contract locked with Vladislav 2026-05-17.** Source of truth =
`RestStateMachine.current` (not display text). Two-layer guard:
ChatScreen blocks at the gesture, `DefaultMessagingService.sendAudio`
+ `CallManager.startCall` block at the send layer for any path that
bypasses the UI (programmatic, deep-link, retry). Rule:
`voiceAllowed == callsAllowed == (mode == null || mode == WsActive)`
— `null` covers Alpha 1 / pre-bootstrap where there is no hybrid
transport object. Structured logs on every guard hit so the path
is visible in `PhantomHybrid:V` capture without describing what
was on screen. Scope strictly guard-only — no transport / crypto /
DB / chunking change; voice on REST gets its real fix in PR-D2b.

**Implementation (PR #162 → squash `210b827f`).** Three commits
folded into one squash merge:

- **D2a (initial).** `DefaultMessagingService` adds
  `canSendVoice: () -> Boolean = { true }` ctor param; `sendAudio`
  returns `Result.failure(IllegalStateException(...))` and logs
  `VOICE_TX blocked_limited_realtime conv=… audioBytes=… source=send_layer`
  (default `{ true }` preserves existing tests). `CallManager` adds
  `canStartCalls: () -> Boolean = { true }`; `startCall` returns
  early + `CALL_TX blocked_limited_realtime to=… source=call_manager`
  — no `CALLING` state transition, no `AudioManager` touch on a
  closed gate. `AppContainer` wires both lambdas to the same source
  (`hybridTransport?.stateMachine?.state?.value == RestMode.WsActive`),
  `null` returns `true`. ChatScreen `onMicClick` + `onVoiceCall`
  Snackbar refusal at gesture start; mic guard also tears down
  any in-progress recorder (`mediaRecorder.stop/release/null` +
  `audioFile.delete`) if the transport degrades mid-recording so
  the user sees the Snackbar instead of a silent send-then-fail.
- **D2a.1 (localisation + UI observability).** Snackbar copy moved
  out of inline Kotlin into Android string resources
  (`res/values/strings.xml` EN). UI guard sites add
  `Log.w("PhantomHybrid", "MEDIA_CAPABILITY blocked feature=voice|call
  mode=$mode source=ui recording_in_progress=…")`. Existing send-layer
  logs extended with `source=send_layer` / `source=call_manager` so
  a log reader can tell at a glance which layer fired.
- **D2a.2 (drop values-ru).** Test #53.1 evidence showed that
  shipping a Russian translation for just these two strings while
  the rest of the chat UI is hardcoded English inline made the
  Snackbar disagree with the surrounding screen on RU-locale
  devices. Delete `res/values-ru/strings.xml`; keep only the EN
  default. Comment in `values/strings.xml` documents that the
  Russian copy comes back during a proper centralised localisation
  pass, not piecemeal.

**Test #53 (2026-05-17 evening).** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on
Tele2 LTE Иркутская + emulator-5554. UI guards visibly fired (mic
+ call buttons both refused with Snackbar). Architect flagged two
gaps before merge: (1) no `MEDIA_CAPABILITY` log line — UI-level
guard was invisible in logcat unless the user described the screen;
(2) RU Snackbar copy on EN-locale device — localisation needed.

**Test #53.1 (D2a.1 APK, same hardware).** UI logs now present and
correct on Tecno: `MEDIA_CAPABILITY blocked feature=voice
mode=RestActive source=ui recording_in_progress=false` and
`feature=call mode=RestActive source=ui` both captured during the
`RestActive` window. Send-layer logs not triggered (UI caught the
gestures first, which is the intended layering). Emulator stayed
on `WsActive` end-to-end, voice/call buttons remained enabled —
expected, the contract is "Limited realtime blocks media, stable
WS allows it". Bonus evidence on the emulator: REST migrate path
already saw a real oversize voice envelope —
`migrate_pending_skip_oversize id=e96223a6 bodyBytes=7608 max=4096`
— which is the concrete case PR-D2b will need to handle. Snackbar
text however still rendered Russian because Tecno's system locale
is Russian and the platform correctly chose `values-ru/`.

**Test #53.2 (D2a.2 APK, same hardware).** Vladislav confirmed
visual PASS — Snackbar copy now renders English on the device,
matching the rest of the EN-only chat UI. Architect signed off:
acceptance criterion for localisation is visual on the device
(snackbar text does not show up in `logcat`), and D2a's job as a
**temporary UX guard** is done — Limited realtime blocks media,
stable WS allows media, EN copy across the board, structured logs
on every guard layer.

**Status after merge.**

- ✅ Voice messages blocked at UI + send layer on `RestActive` /
  `WsCandidate`; English Snackbar; no silent failure.
- ✅ Calls blocked at UI + `CallManager.startCall`; English
  Snackbar; no `CALLING` state, no `AudioManager` touch on closed
  gate.
- ✅ Structured logs at both layers (`MEDIA_CAPABILITY` UI,
  `VOICE_TX` / `CALL_TX` send layer) with explicit `source=` so a
  log reader sees which path fired.
- ✅ Text fallback unaffected — Test #53 / #53.1 / #53.2 all
  delivered ordinary text messages through the REST path while the
  media guards were closed.

**What this does NOT do — explicitly.** Voice messages on REST
**are still not delivered**; they are now politely refused instead
of silently failing. Calls on REST **are still not delivered**;
they are now politely refused instead of opening a never-connecting
call screen. The real fixes are tracked separately:

- **PR-D2b** — voice-over-REST chunking. Real fix. Split audio into
  ≤ 4096-byte (target ≈ 2.5–3 KB for headroom) encrypted chunks,
  ACK strictly after save, receiver reassembles by `voiceId`, single
  DB voice message after `assembly_complete`. Test #53.1 emulator
  log already produced the concrete oversize case
  (`bodyBytes=7608 > max=4096`) so D2b has real telemetry to design
  against, not just specification.
- **C-track** — calls on a stable realtime channel.
  - **PR-C1** `TransportCapabilities` typed gate
    (`text / voiceMessages / calls / realtimeUdp`) — replaces the
    `state == WsActive` shorthand once Reality endpoint pool + WS
    probe land.
  - **PR-C2** Reality endpoint pool + realistic probe (current
    probe is `/health`, which doesn't catch the Tele2 Layer A
    silent-WS-drop pattern; need a WS-handshake probe).
  - **PR-C3** TURN-over-TLS:443 or custom Opus-over-Reality —
    whichever survives Tele2 / МТС / Beeline LTE in field tests.

**Open follow-ups updated.** D-track item D2a moves from "open"
to "closed (UX guard layer)". D2b remains the headline real-fix
work. C1–C3 remain queued separately. Tele2 WS keepalive baseline
**unchanged** — phone-side WS still dies every ~31 s with
`pings_received=0 inbound_frames=0` (the Test #48 Tele2 Layer A
profile the REST fallback was designed for, not a D2a regression).

**Key commits / PRs.**

### 2026-05-17 (sat) · Test #52 PASS — PR-D1d merged, fast active-outbound ACK deadline closes the ~40 s WS→REST latency gap on Tele2 LTE

**Goal.** Verify PR-D1d (10 s per-envelope ACK deadline) on the same
Tele2 LTE Иркутская hardware that exposed the ~40 s `active_outbound_threshold`
latency in Test #51, and merge if the contract holds.

**Test #52 setup.** Tecno `<redacted-device-serial>` on Tele2 LTE Иркутская +
emulator-5554 on dev Wi-Fi. APK from `feat/pr-d1d-active-outbound-ack-deadline`
head `5859f306` (PR-D1d + round-1 hardening `armAckDeadlineLocked` cancels
any pre-existing Job before replacement). Structured `REST_TRACE` +
`PhantomRelay` capture per `feedback_logcat_format`.

**Acceptance — fast active-outbound degrade.** First stuck outbound
envelope migrates to REST after exactly the configured `ACK_DEADLINE_MS=10000`,
not after 2× WS session deaths (~40–60 s). Phone-side timeline of
`397df3c7` (first text after bootstrap):

```
23:59:05.459  Sending envelope: id=397df3c7 seq=1 sealed=true payloadBytes=1368
23:59:05.460  outbound_ack_deadline_armed id=397df3c7 timeoutMs=10000
23:59:15.464  outbound_ack_deadline_expired id=397df3c7 ageMs=10004    ← timer fires at 10 s
23:59:15.468  mode_switched from=WsActive to=REST_ACTIVE reason=active_outbound_ack_timeout
23:59:15.469  migrate_pending_arm from=WsActive to=RestActive
23:59:15.475  migrate_pending_send id=397df3c7 seq=1 bodyBytes=1808
23:59:16.130  send_response id=397df3c7 status=201 elapsedMs=625        ← REST POST success
23:59:16.130  migrate_pending_ok id=397df3c7 status=201
23:59:16.131  migrate_pending_done ok=1 failed=0
```

Total user-visible latency from `send_start` to relay-accepted = **~11 s**
(10 s deadline + 0.6 s REST POST). Test #51 baseline was ~40 s on the
same network.

Emulator received the migrated envelope correctly:

```
05:00:06.484  Received envelope: id=397df3c7 sealed=true payloadBytes=1368
05:00:06.532  Decrypt OK after bootstrap: plaintextBytes=62
05:00:06.539  Payload parsed: type=message textLen=3
05:00:06.567  handleDeliver DONE for id=397df3c7 (ack-deliver sent)
```

**Acceptance — healthy ACK path cancels deadline.** Emulator → phone
`7cc11e42` (steady-state direction, ACK arrives within ~100 ms):

```
05:00:13.151  Sending envelope: id=7cc11e42 seq=1 payloadBytes=1368
05:00:13.152  outbound_ack_deadline_armed id=7cc11e42 timeoutMs=10000
05:00:13.255  outbound_ack_deadline_cancelled id=7cc11e42 reason=ack_received
05:00:13.255  Ack from relay: id=7cc11e42 status=delivered
```

Timer armed → cancelled within 100 ms. No false REST switch on a healthy
WS frame. Helper invariant (one pendingAck msgId ⇒ at most one active
deadline Job) holds.

**Acceptance — subsequent texts route through REST cleanly.** After the
first envelope migrates, the orchestrator stays in `RestActive` for the
rest of the session. Tele2 → emu (`3d92286f`, `46411fcd`, `30c2ab4d`)
and emu → Tele2 (`d7183d3e`, `8f590e1`, `b635b761`) all complete with
`status=201` + REST poll + decrypt OK. Six texts round-tripped over
~3 minutes on Tele2 LTE.

**Tele2 baseline acknowledged.** Phone-side WS continues to die every
~31 s (`SocketTimeoutException: sent ping but didn't receive pong within
15000ms (after 0 successful ping/pongs)`) — server sees `pings_received=0
inbound_frames=0` as before. This is the Test #48 Tele2 Layer A profile
that REST fallback was designed for; the WS-death cadence is **not** a
D1d regression. D1d's contract is "do not wait for the WS to die to
notice the outbound is stuck", which is exactly what the logs show.

**Voice / calls confirmed out-of-scope for this PR.** Test #52 logs
contain zero `audio_chunk` / `VOICE_TX` / `VOICE_RX` lines. Media
delivery on Limited realtime networks is the next track:

- **PR-D2a** (next, this session) — UI + send-layer guard so voice on
  Limited realtime fails fast with a clear message instead of "recorded
  and disappeared".
- **PR-D2b** — voice-over-REST chunking (body ≤ 4096 b, ACK after save,
  receiver reassembly).
- **C-track** — calls on a stable realtime channel (Reality endpoint
  pool with realistic probe, then TURN-TLS or custom Opus-over-Reality).

See [Open follow-ups](#open-follow-ups--unfinished-items) above for the
full queue.

**Key commits / PRs.**

- PR #160 (squash-merged as `3e4293c3`) — `feat(transport): PR-D1d —
  fast active-outbound ACK deadline (10s per-envelope timer)`.
- Round-1 hardening commit `5859f306` (one-liner in
  `armAckDeadlineLocked`: `ackDeadlineJobs.remove(msgId)?.cancel()`
  before replacement, preserves "at most one Job per msgId" invariant).
- PR #159 (squash-merged as `67cfd0b0`) — Test #51 entry + MASTER_TIMELINE
  bump.
- 5 production removal sites for `pendingAcks` routed through
  `removePendingAckLocked` / `clearAllPendingAcksLocked` helpers; 2
  insertion sites (`send()` + flush re-track) route through
  `armAckDeadlineLocked`. State machine remains a pure reducer;
  HybridRelayTransport does the `state == RestMode.WsActive` mode-check
  before submitting the event.

### 2026-05-17 (sat) · Test #51 partial PASS — PR-D1c + D1c.1 merged to master, bootstrap-ordering bug closed end-to-end on Tele2 LTE

**Goal.** Verify PR-D1c (migrate pending WS outbox → REST on mode switch) + PR-D1c.1 (REST session token lifecycle / CAS / mutex / 401 refresh fix) on real hardware. Test #50 (2026-05-16) had reproduced the bootstrap-ordering symptom on Tele2 LTE: the migration logic ran but the very first REST send returned 401 because of three token-cache bugs. PR-D1c.1 fixed all three and was bundled into PR #157.

**Test #51 setup.** Tecno (phone identity `9ecca9679dbc0529…`) on Tele2 LTE Иркутская + emulator-5554 (identity `592cf3c06040…`) on dev Wi-Fi. Fresh install (`pm clear phantom.android` both sides), APK from `feat/pr-d1c-migrate-pending-ws-to-rest` head `61a051f1`, structured `REST_TRACE` capture per `feedback_logcat_format`.

**End-to-end PASS — the full token + migration + REST send chain works.** Compressed phone log timeline:

```
22:28:24 token_refresh_start reason=bootstrap force=true stale=false   ← PR-D1c.1 acquireOrRefreshToken

22:30:04 migrate_pending_ok id=d2416afe status=201
22:30:04 migrate_pending_done ok=1 failed=0
```

Emulator side (same `d2416afe` envelope landing via REST poll on the receiver's side after the sender migrated it):

```
03:30:54 handleDeliver start: id=d2416afe... sealed=true payloadBytes=1368
03:30:54 Sender identified: 9ecca9679dbc0529...
03:30:54 Bootstrapping recipient session: conv=592cf3c06040...
03:30:54 Decrypt OK after bootstrap: plaintextBytes=62                  ← X3DH/double-ratchet session created
03:30:54 Payload parsed: type=message textLen=3
03:30:54 DB insertMessage OK
03:30:54 Creating new conversation as REQUEST
```

The "Decrypt OK after bootstrap" line is the smoking gun. Before PR-D1c the bootstrap envelope was lost when the state machine flipped mid-flight, so the receiver got the *second* message first and had no session — that was the original Test #49/#50 symptom.

**Steady-state validation — REST orchestrator runs cleanly for the full session.** After the first send, the phone stays in `RestActive` and every subsequent send/poll/ack reuses the cached token: `token_reused reason=send` / `reason=poll` / `reason=ack` on every operation, zero additional `/auth/session` calls, all `send_response status=201`. Five more text messages exchanged both directions over ~3 minutes: all delivered, all decrypted, all ack'd. Duplicate envelopes from REST poll redelivery handled by the H2b ledger guard (`inbound_skip_already_processed id=…`).

**What's closed and what's still open after Test #51.** Mapping each architectural concern from Test #48/#49 to its current state on master:

| Concern | Status after Test #51 |
|---|---|
| Direct probe rejecting healthy `/health` on Tele2 | ✅ closed by PR-R0.3 — `direct.result ok=true totalMs=611` |
| REST capability discovery | ✅ closed by PR-D0r/D1/D1b — `rest_fallback=true max_body=4096` advertised, client honours |
| WS→REST mode switch | ✅ closed — `mode_switched from=WsActive to=REST_ACTIVE reason=active_outbound_threshold` fires correctly |
| Pending WS outbox migration to REST | ✅ closed by PR-D1c — `migrate_pending_arm/start/send/ok/done` runs end-to-end |
| Bootstrap envelope ordering across mode switch | ✅ closed by PR-D1c — receiver gets bootstrap envelope first, X3DH session created |
| REST session token cached after bootstrap | ✅ closed by PR-D1c.1 fix #1 — `token_cached reason=bootstrap` then `token_reused` on every subsequent op |
| Concurrent token-refresh race | ✅ closed by PR-D1c.1 fix #2 — `Mutex` + CAS via `staleToken` parameter |
| 401 refresh propagates to retry attempts | ✅ closed by PR-D1c.1 fix #3 — token acquired inside the retry loop |
| Text delivery via REST end-to-end | ✅ confirmed — six messages each direction, all received and decrypted |
| ACK-after-save / inbound deduplication | ✅ confirmed — H2b ledger guard handles REST redelivery |
| **WS→REST latency** | ❌ **~40 s** wait for 2 active counter ticks — UX-blocker for next PR |
| **Voice over REST** | ❌ blocked — `route_send` shows 11–55 KB voice chunks rejected by `send_oversize max=4096` cap |
| Prekey publish response timeout occasionally | ❗ minor — one `upload_fail SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=183696` on the phone log, did not block Test #51 (prekeys were already valid) |

**Merge decision.** Vladislav verdict: merge. Reliability fix is proven on real hardware; the remaining UX latency and voice gaps are next-PR scope, not D1c scope. PR #157 was already `MERGEABLE / CLEAN` with head `61a051f1` (PR #158 had been bundled into the D1c branch as a merge commit on 2026-05-16). Squash-merged to master as `d7a05273` with a commit message that enumerates the three D1c.1 token-lifecycle fixes and the Test #51 evidence. Branch `feat/pr-d1c-migrate-pending-ws-to-rest` deleted.

**Next-PR plan locked.** Discussion converged on three follow-ups in priority order:

1. **PR-D1d — fast active-outbound degrade.** The 40-second wait for two counter ticks is the dominant UX cost in Test #51. New mechanism: when an envelope enters `pendingAcks` over WS, arm a per-envelope ACK deadline timer = 10 s. If ACK for that `msg_id` does not arrive before the deadline, emit `RestStateMachine.Event.ActiveOutboundAckTimeout(msg_id, ageMs)` and switch `WS_ACTIVE → REST_ACTIVE` immediately; PR-D1c migration then picks up the same envelope and delivers it over REST. Reset condition is strict: timer is cancelled **only** by ACK on the same envelope-id (not by any incoming WS frame — partial socket liveness ≠ ACK for our outbound envelope). 10 s chosen over 8 s (false-positive risk on radio wake / weak LTE) and over 15 s (still feels slow). Expected outcome on Tele2: first message latency drops from ~40-60 s to ~10-15 s. Council not requested — the trade-off is well-defined and the empirical baseline (`pingInterval(15s)` already deployed in Run C on healthy WS) is the safety margin. New `REST_TRACE` lines: `ack_deadline_armed id=… timeoutMs=10000` / `ack_deadline_cancelled id=… reason=ack_received` / `ack_deadline_expired id=… ageMs=10000` / `mode_switched … reason=active_outbound_ack_timeout`. Test #52 acceptance: first phone→emu text under 15 s, no false REST switch on emulator direct smoke.
2. **PR-D2a — UI gating for voice in `Limited realtime`.** Honest stop-gap before D2b. When `RestStateMachine.state == RestActive`, the chat composer must either disable the voice button or surface a message: "Голосовые временно недоступны в режиме Limited realtime. Текстовые сообщения доставляются через резервный канал." / "Voice messages are temporarily unavailable in Limited realtime mode. Text messages are delivered via REST fallback." Stops the user from believing a 55 KB voice envelope "sent" when it was rejected client-side by `send_oversize`. Small PR, no protocol changes.
3. **PR-D2b — voice-over-REST chunking.** Larger protocol work: target REST body ≤ 2-3 KB per chunk (well under the 4096 cap), receiver reassembles with sequence ordering + retry + reassembly timer. Not merged with D2a — separate scope, separate review pass. Sequenced after D1d.

**Deferred follow-ups.**
- **Prekey upload response timeout fallback (PR-R0.5 / PR-PK1).** After POST `/prekeys/publish` times out, query `GET /prekeys/status`; if the server already shows fresh prekeys, treat the upload as successful. Same root cause as Tele2 Layer B (POST upstream OK, response dropped downstream). Low priority — did not block Test #51.
- **`mirror_envelope_to_rest_store` `from: ""` for sealed-sender envelopes** still queued from 2026-05-16; not surfaced by Test #51 because sealed-sender is the Alpha-2 default.

**Process notes.**
- Confirmed PR-D1c.1 was already inside PR #157 (head OID `61a051f1`) before squash-merging. The `gh pr view 157 --json` cross-check is a cheap habit; running it before every cross-PR merge has saved at least one "merged the wrong head" near-miss already.
- Architect (sub-agent) framed PR-D1d threshold question as "8 / 10 / 15 s, per-envelope vs global, reset on any incoming frame vs only ACK-of-same-id". Three trade-off pairs in one prompt. Vladislav picked the strictest answer set on all three. Saving here so the next session does not re-litigate the same questions: **10 s, per-envelope, reset only by ACK(same-id)**.
- Squash-merge commit body for PR #157 was crafted to enumerate the three D1c.1 fixes + Test #51 evidence + known follow-ups. Future `git log` greps for the bootstrap-ordering bug will find this commit directly without needing to walk the PR branch history.

### 2026-05-16 (fri) · Tele2 reliability Round 2 + REST fallback transport (full stack) — PR-R0.2/R0.3/R0.4a/R0.4b + PR-D0r + PR-D1 + PR-D1b all merged

**Seven PRs merged on master in one day.** Two threads: (1) finish the Tele2 reliability sprint that started 2026-05-15, (2) discover a deeper Tele2 failure mode (WS frame layer is dropped after handshake) and design + ship the **complete** REST short-poll fallback transport — relay endpoints (D0r) + Kotlin client library (D1) + live wire-up into Android messaging (D1b).

**Thread 1 — Tele2 reliability Round 2 (4 PRs).**

- **PR-R0.2 #147** (`030b3108`) — drop OPK publish batch 100 → 40, brings the prekey publish body from 13 903 to 5 863 bytes, slipping under the 8 192-byte Tele2 middlebox cut (the deterministic `bytes_read=8192, status=408, duration=30s` signature observed across Tests #43-#44 on the same Tele2 SIM). Test #45 (2026-05-15) confirmed `prekey_publish_ok status=201 elapsedMs=902`, Direct stays Direct end-to-end on Tele2 without falling to Tor.
- **PR-V0b-diag #148** (`77b96dc1`) — `VOICE_RX` structured logs across `audio_chunk` receiver pipeline. Diagnostic-only; lets Test #46 attribute voice-message MIA between transport, decrypt, or persistence.
- **PR-R0.4a #149** (`18a23b6d`) — stop false reconnect cycling from AlarmManager's stale-inbound check. The AlarmManager-driven proactive reconnect was treating "no inbound frames for ≥45 s" as a stale socket on Tele2 LTE where inbound frames legitimately can pause through Probing. Wakeup receiver now pokes connectivity instead of forcing reconnect.
- **PR-R0.3 #150** (`007ed061`) — replace Ktor-engine Direct probe with a native OkHttp `/health` GET. Ktor engine was reusing pool entries half-closed by Tele2 NAT, returning `ok=false` while SSH `curl` confirmed `HTTP/2 200 48 ms`. New native probe: fresh `OkHttpClient` per call, HTTP/1.1 pinned, `Connection: close`, `ConnectionPool(0)`, `retryOnConnectionFailure(false)`, two attempts with 400 ms backoff, outer timeout raised 5 s → 25 s. Direct probe now reports `ok=true totalMs=1008` on the Tele2 SIM.
- **PR-R0.4b #151** (`727e1a83`) — remove the in-process dead-socket watchdog `forceReconnect`. `KtorRelayTransport`'s `lastInboundFrameMark` is updated only on `Frame.Text`, not on OkHttp WS-protocol Pong, so an idle-but-healthy session was being torn down every 60 s. Watchdog is now passive (idle log only).

**Thread 2 — Test #48 revealed deeper Tele2 layers + REST fallback transport (PR-D0r + PR-D1).**

Test #48 ran R0.3 + R0.4a + R0.4b on the same Tele2 SIM. SSH-pulled relay + Caddy logs (delegated to Vladislav per `feedback_ssh_delegation`) showed two new failure modes that were *hidden* behind the prekey-publish bug we just fixed:

- **Layer A — WS frame layer dropped upstream after handshake.** Every phone WS session on the relay side: `pings_received=0, pongs_sent=0, inbound_frames=0, outbound_frames=0, duration_ms ≈ 153 000` (server's own read timeout). Phone client side: every session dies at 31 s with `SocketTimeoutException: sent ping but didn't receive pong within 15000ms (after 0 successful ping/pongs)`. The 31 vs 153 s asymmetry proves the WS Upgrade handshake passes through the middlebox, but Frame.Text upstream is silently dropped after; phone TCP close not propagated, relay's own read deadline eventually tears down at ~150 s. OkHttp `pingInterval(15s)` timeout is *symptom*, not cause — if we disabled it, WS would live longer as a zombie but still get 0 inbound frames and 0 ACKs.
- **Layer B — POST 5863b body OK upstream, but response dropped downstream.** Caddy access log: 3× `POST /prekeys/publish bytes_read=5863 status=201 duration=2.9ms resp_size=18` server-side success. Phone client side: all 3 attempts time out with `SocketTimeoutException elapsedMs=61283ms` waiting for the 18-byte 201 response. Server sent it within 3 ms; the response never reached phone within 60 s. Asymmetric to Layer A (where upstream is what's broken), here downstream is broken after a non-trivial POST upload — suggesting the middlebox marks the flow "suspicious" after volume crosses some threshold.
- **Layer C (positive) — small GET req/resp works.** `/health` (15 b resp), `/prekeys/status` (48 b resp), `/auth/challenge` (110 b resp): all consistently 200, sub-ms. Direct mode on Tele2 is partially usable but unreliable as a persistent flow; reliable only for small GET round-trips.

**Why PR-R0.4c was killed.** First architect take suggested disabling OkHttp `pingInterval` (let WS live longer). I caught the bigger picture from the server-side data: `pings_received=0` proves phone pings never reach the relay — OkHttp's own Ping timer firing is just measuring the absence of return Pongs that never had a chance to be requested. Disabling client-side Ping would only extend the zombie WS lifetime; it would not make a single byte of data reach the recipient. R0.4c-disable-ping is **dropped from the plan entirely**.

**Locked direction.** REST short-poll fallback with server-side idempotency: client retries POSTs whose responses were dropped, server dedupes by `Idempotency-Key`. Plus capability discovery so old relays keep clients in WS-only mode (no behaviour regression).

- **PR-D0r #152** (`1c1a91a9`) — Rust relay endpoints `/auth/session` (bearer token, retry-safe via `(identity, challenge, signing_pubkey, signature)` cache), `/relay/send` (one envelope per call, `Idempotency-Key` header required, status 201 fresh / 200 replay / 409 conflict), `/relay/poll` (≤ 1 envelope per call, server retains until `/relay/ack-deliver`), `/relay/ack-deliver` (idempotent removal). Sha-256 body hash via `sha2` crate (originally `DefaultHasher` — collision attack on the 200-replay vs 409-conflict decision was the fourth blocker from review). Per-identity LRU idempotency cache (10 K keys × 24 h TTL). Capability discovery in `/auth/session` response: `rest_fallback:true, max_send_body_bytes:4096, poll_max_envelopes:1`. Public mirror helpers `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store` / `remove_envelope_from_rest_store` called from BOTH the WS `Send` / `ack-deliver` arms in `routes.rs` AND the REST send/ack handlers, so WS and REST share envelope state in both directions (was the second review blocker). `sealed_sender` preserved end-to-end through send → poll → live WS delivery JSON (was the third review blocker). 10 integration tests including 4 new ones added in the second review cycle: `session_replay_with_different_signature_returns_401`, `rest_send_preserves_sealed_sender`, `ws_simulated_send_mirrors_into_rest_poll`, `ws_simulated_ack_clears_rest_poll`. Deployed to `relay.phntm.pro` 2026-05-16; smoke-test (`/auth/session` 422 on empty body, `/relay/send` 401 no-auth, `/relay/poll` 401 no-auth) confirms all four endpoints live.
- **PR-D1 #153** (`6f6ade20`) — Kotlin client library for the REST fallback transport. CommonMain: `RestFallbackTransport` (interface + JSON wire models with `@SerialName` snake_case, `RelayCapabilities` with `SAFE_DEFAULTS = restFallback=false`), `RestStateMachine` (pure state machine `WS_ACTIVE ↔ REST_ACTIVE ↔ WS_CANDIDATE` with locked triggers: 2 active fails OR 3 idle fails to enter REST, 60 s alive OR outbound ACK to commit back to WS), `RestFallbackOrchestrator` (lifecycle, token management with retry-safe `/auth/session`, capability gate, 5-attempt retry with 1/3/8/20/60 s backoff and stable `Idempotency-Key`, adaptive poll loop 2/5/15 s). AndroidMain: `AndroidNativeOkHttpRestFallbackTransport` (HTTP/1.1 pinned, `Connection: close`, fresh client per call — same pattern as PR-R0.1 prekey transport and PR-R0.3 Direct probe). `expect/actual createRestFallbackTransport()` factory. 28 unit tests. Shipped **inert** — library built, orchestrator dormant, capability gate keeps it disabled against any relay that does not advertise `rest_fallback:true`. Live wire-up landed same session as PR-D1b (below).

- **PR-D1b #155** (`e9bdf462`) — wire the REST fallback transport into the live Android messaging delivery path. New `HybridRelayTransport` wrapper at the **Android app layer** (`apps/android/src/androidMain/kotlin/phantom/android/transport/HybridRelayTransport.kt`) owns a `KtorRelayTransport` + a `RestFallbackOrchestrator` and implements the existing `RelayTransport` interface. `DefaultMessagingService` itself is **untouched** — it still talks to `RelayTransport`; `AppContainer` just hands it a `HybridRelayTransport` instead of a bare `KtorRelayTransport`. Routing: outbound `send` switches by `RestStateMachine.current` mode (WS or REST); inbound merges WS `Frame.Text` deliveries and REST `PollEnvelope` deliveries into one `SharedFlow`; `sendDeliveryAck` routes to whichever transport originally delivered the envelope. New `RestInboundDeduplicator` (commonMain, 9 unit tests) provides three-state dedup (`Emit` / `SkipNoAck` / `ReAck`) with **`pendingAck` overriding `recentlyEmitted`** so an envelope DMS is still mid-decrypt-ing never re-emits even if the recent window evicted by TTL or capacity. Three-layer duplicate protection (persistent `ProcessedEnvelopeRepository` → in-memory `RestInboundDeduplicator` → DMS's `activeProcessing`). State-machine events serialized via `stateMachineLock: Mutex` with an atomic `submitStateEvents(vararg)` batch for the WS-ACK pair (`WsFrameTextReceived + WsOutboundAckReceived`) so `WsSessionEnded` cannot race between them and revert a `WsCandidate → WsActive` commit. WS-passthrough collectors **always** start at `bootstrapAndStart()` entry regardless of capability — DMS keeps receiving WS messages even when the relay is on a pre-D0r build or `/auth/session` fails. Idempotent `wsPassthroughStarted` guard. `maybeRetryBootstrap()` triggered from `WsSessionEnded` with rate-limit 60 s so a transient `/auth/session` failure self-recovers without leaving the app permanently in WS-only mode. **Graceful degrade**: if `identity.signingPublicKeyHex == null` (Alpha 1 record mid-migration), hybrid is NOT constructed; app stays on bare WS transport and logs a warning — MigrationManager backfills on a later run.

**PR-D1b contract review took 3 rounds.** Vladislav rejected the first draft with 3 blockers (WS passthrough was gated on capability — DMS would have stopped receiving WS messages on bootstrap fail; inline dedup acked while DMS was still processing — would have broken at-least-once with the relay; state-machine events were not serialized) + a strong note (no bootstrap retry → permanent WS-only mode after transient failure) + minor (null signing key crashed instead of degrading). Round 2 fixed all five; Vladislav then caught two more (dedup's `isRecent && isPending → SkipNoAck` rule didn't cover the `!isRecent && isPending` case — a pending id whose recent entry was TTL- or capacity-evicted would re-Emit, racing DMS; and the ACK event pair wasn't atomic under the lock — `WsSessionEnded` could race between WsFrameTextReceived and WsOutboundAckReceived). Round 3 landed `isPending`-first precedence in `RestInboundDeduplicator.resolve()`, two new tests (`pending_id_after_ttl_still_skip_no_ack`, `pending_id_evicted_by_capacity_still_skip_no_ack`), `submitStateEvents(vararg)` atomic-batch helper, and idempotent `wsPassthroughStarted` guard. Vladislav approved + merged. Final stats: 9/9 `RestInboundDeduplicatorTest` green; `:shared:core:transport:jvmTest` green; `:apps:android:assembleDebug` green; CI green on `07a5a280`. Test #49 acceptance now redefined around hybrid behaviour: emulator Direct stays on WS (no `mode_switched`, no `route_send mode=REST`), Tele2 phone surfaces `mode_switched from=WS_ACTIVE to=REST_ACTIVE reason=active_outbound_threshold` after the 2-active-fail trigger, and text actually delivers in both directions through the new path.

**Review discipline that worked.** Vladislav's first review of D0r found 4 contract-level blockers I had missed when I committed the relay-builder agent's output as a checkpoint. All four (replay cache key, store sync, sealed_sender, hash function) closed in one follow-up commit plus 4 new dedicated tests. Lesson: when committing an autonomous agent's output, do a full design-review pass before declaring it ready — the agent satisfies its own definition of done, not the wider contract. Vladislav's second review of D1 caught the symmetric `PollEnvelope.sealedSenderBase64` gap (server now emits the field, client model didn't have it — would have silently dropped sealed-sender on the wire even after the SendRequest fix). Both reviews were posted as PR comments with a clear "do not merge until X" ack pattern.

**SSH delegation pattern proven again.** Per `feedback_ssh_delegation.md` rule, when design decisions depended on VPS-side state I handed Vladislav exact one-liner SSH commands with expected output. Two key uses this session: (1) `curl https://relay.phntm.pro/health` to verify the architect's assumption about `/health` existing before drafting PR-R0.3 design (returned `HTTP/2 200 48 ms`), (2) `docker logs phantom-relay --since 30m | grep -E "910be664|8e1cfd02"` to confirm whether envelopes actually reached the server during Test #48 (they didn't, with one eventual success at 06:49 UTC ~16 min after sender stopped logging — proving the persistent retry loop *can* succeed but on a randomly opening window).

**Open items handed to next session.**

- **APK build + Test #49** is the next blocking step. APK built locally on `master @ e9bdf462` ready to install. Test #49 acceptance redefined: not "Online via Direct" anymore (that's necessary but no longer sufficient), the real PASS is text phone → emu and emu → phone actually arriving through the REST fallback when the WS frame layer is degraded. Concrete log signatures: emulator Direct must show `REST_TRACE capability_enabled` but NOT `mode_switched` / `route_send mode=REST`; Tele2 phone (whenever it next reproduces the Test #48 signature) must produce `mode_switched from=WS_ACTIVE to=REST_ACTIVE reason=active_outbound_threshold` and `ack_after_save` / `ack_sent status=200`.
- **PR-D2 voice strategy** queued behind Test #49 stability. Options on the table: small-chunk audio under 4 KB body cap, or Reality routing dedicated to voice. Decided after Test #49 outcome.
- **PR-D1c network-change event** — feed `NetworkChanged` into `RestStateMachine` so a Wi-Fi → cellular handover (or back) re-evaluates mode without waiting for the next session-end. Deliberately deferred from D1b to keep the wire-up PR focused.
- **PR-R1a `TransportCapabilities`** + call gating. Parallel design track. Tor route → `calls = false, voiceMessages = false (or limited)`; Direct/Reality routes keep all three. If user presses Call while active route is Tor, the UI must say "Calls require Direct or Reality connection" rather than attempt a WebRTC session that cannot work.
- **Non-blocking follow-up:** `mirror_envelope_to_rest_store` currently writes `from: ""` regardless of whether the envelope is sealed-sender or plain. For non-sealed legacy messages on the REST path this would surface as `from: ""` in `/relay/poll` instead of the real sender. Production Alpha-2 is sealed-sender by default, so not a regression, but worth a 5-line fix when we next touch the helper.
- **Lesson saved to internal memory** (`feedback_agent_output_review.md`): autonomous-agent output is a checkpoint, not a finished PR. Always run a full contract-review pass before merge — wire contracts on both sides, crypto/auth boundaries, cross-subsystem state, "what's stored / what's deleted". Vladislav's D0r review caught 4 contract blockers I missed after relay-builder's output; his D1b review caught 5 across two rounds. Treat every agent-produced PR as input to my review, not output of it.

---



- **Goal.** Phase 1 was supposed to start with Test #6 retest on real cellular. Test #42 (2026-05-14 evening, Tele2 LTE Иркутская) instead saw the phone fall through Direct → Reality → Tor in ~2 min 20 s, with Reality probe failing at 20 s and Direct probe failing at 5 s. Today's session: figure out *why* — diagnose-before-fix per project rule, then commit on a fix. Spent the session in a steady diagnostic narrowing rather than a code session.
- **Where we started (wrong hypothesis).** Initial reading of Test #42 phone log: "Tele2 LTE Иркутская blocks Direct AND Reality, only Tor pierces TSPU." This is the same headline pattern from Test #6 (МТС on Tecno, 2026-05-05) and made Reality-first sound urgent. First architectural reaction was multi-VPS Reality pool. Vladislav reasonably asked me to verify before committing to deployment spend.
- **Server-side SSH diagnostic on `relay.phntm.pro` (read-only).** Six containers (`phantom-relay`, `phantom-xray` 8443, `phantom-caddy` 443, `phantom-tor`, `phantom-webtunnel-bridge`, `phantom-ntfy`) all healthy. Self-test `curl -X POST .../prekeys/publish` from the VPS itself returned HTTP 422 in 24 ms — server is fine, the 30 s timeout the phone sees is not a server-side hang. Xray actively listening on `0.0.0.0:8443`. So the bottleneck is somewhere on the path Tele2 LTE → Hetzner 65.108.154.152, not the application.
- **Termux curl from Vladislav's Tele2 LTE handset** (IP `<redacted-client-ip>`, WHOIS = `T2 Russia AS41330` — same network as Test #42, confirmed):
  - `GET /health` (http2) → 200 OK in <1 s ✅
  - `GET /health` (http/1.1, `User-Agent: ktor-client` to match the app) → 200 OK ✅
  - `GET /auth/challenge?identity=<64-hex>` (http/1.1) → 200 OK with JSON ✅
  - `GET /ws` with `Connection: Upgrade, Upgrade: websocket, Sec-WebSocket-*` headers (http/1.1) → 401 Unauthorized in <1 s ✅ (401 is the expected server response for a WS handshake without a signed challenge — it proves the WebSocket endpoint is reachable and Caddy handed control to the relay).
  - Chrome on the same handset to `https://relay.phntm.pro/health` → returned a 404-style "page not found", almost certainly a Chrome auto-redirect or service-worker quirk; orthogonal to the diagnosis.
  - Net: **TSPU on Tele2 LTE Иркутская is NOT blocking our Hetzner IP**, NOT blocking TLS handshake, NOT blocking WebSocket Upgrade, NOT blocking small REST GETs. The "Direct/Reality probes fail" narrative does not match the actual network conditions on the same SIM today.
- **The actual finding — Caddy access log for the identity `d19f8018e1ddd918…` (Vladislav's phone) during the live retest (~02:40 UTC):**

  ```
  02:40:06  GET  /prekeys/status   200  1.7  ms  ✅
  02:40:38  POST /prekeys/publish  408 30.05 s   ❌  bytes_read: 0, Content-Length: 13903
  02:40:38  POST /prekeys/publish  408 30.05 s   ❌  bytes_read: 0, Content-Length: 13903   ← second parallel POST, different ephemeral port (16889 vs 16890)
  02:41:10  GET  /prekeys/status   200  1.0  ms  ✅
  ```

  The phone's OkHttp client opens the TCP/TLS connection, sends the HTTP/1.1 request headers (`Content-Length: 13903`), then **never delivers any of the 13.9 KB body**. Server reads zero body bytes and times out the request at exactly the same 30 s the client's `readTimeout` expires. Same SocketTimeoutException stack on the client (`okhttp3.internal.http1.HeadersReader.readLine` → `Http1ExchangeCodec.readResponseHeaders`) — client is blocked waiting for response headers, server is blocked waiting for request body. Classic deadlock signature for OkHttp upload-body stuck on Android mobile.
- **Architect-2 caught the misread.** I anchored on `bytes_read: 0` and proposed a TSPU "body filter" hypothesis. Architect-2 read the full signature — HTTP/1.1 stack-trace, clean 30 s duration that equals the client `readTimeout` exactly, two simultaneous POSTs from independent ephemeral ports, all other endpoints fine on the same network — and correctly identified the two real bugs:
  1. **Bug A — OkHttp HTTP/1.1 POST body upload stuck on Android mobile carrier.** Same class of failure as the OkHttp HTTP/2 stream-stuck bug PR-G4 closed (`fix/rest-http1-only-pr-g4`, #124). Pinning REST to H1.1 fixed the HTTP/2 head-of-line case; large H1.1 body upload on a mobile-carrier path hits a different latent OkHttp bug. Same hardware-stack root cause class, different surface.
  2. **Bug B — Race condition publishing in parallel from two reconnect generations.** The Caddy log shows two POSTs at the same millisecond from different ephemeral ports, same identity. Each reconnect generation re-triggers `publishPreKeys()` without checking whether a publish is already in flight. Two parallel uploads doubles the failure surface and wastes battery / bandwidth.
- **Strategic-pivot consequences (2026-05-15).** Locked in [`memory/project_strategic_pivot_2026_05_15.md`](../) (internal memory) and [`memory/diagnostic_tele2_2026_05_15.md`](../):
  - **Tor demoted to text-only emergency fallback.** Cannot carry WebRTC (no UDP through onion, 500 ms–2 s one-way latency, insufficient bandwidth for Opus); voice messages and calls require Direct or Reality. This was already implicit but is now explicit policy.
  - **Reality remains the load-bearing mobile transport for the RU user**, but multi-VPS deployment is **NOT** the right next step — the data did not actually support the "Hetzner CIDR blocked" hypothesis it would have been justified by. The cheaper-first experiments (different SNI on the same VPS, then Oracle Cloud Always Free ARM VM if needed) remain queued, but only after PR-R0 lands and we re-baseline.
  - **Phase 1 connectivity matrix PAUSED.** Collecting 5 more `Test #43..#47` data points with the same OkHttp publish bug present would have produced data we can't trust. The matrix resumes once PR-R0 + PR-Diag merge and Tele2 retest succeeds without dropping to Tor purely on publish-timeout grounds.
- **Two PRs launched (parallel, non-overlapping files).** Both via `kmp-builder` agent in background, no auto-merge — Vladislav reviews and merges.
  - **PR-R0 — prekey publish body reliability.** Dedicated `createPreKeyPublishHttpClient()` (HTTP/1.1 only, `Connection: close`, `ConnectionPool(0, 1, SECONDS)`, no request-body compression, separate connect/write/read timeouts) used by `PreKeyApiClient.publishPreKeys()` only; small GETs (`/status`, `/bundle`) keep the existing shared `createRestHttpClient()`. `kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex` on the publish call so duplicate triggers from concurrent reconnect generations debounce. Retry with 500 / 1500 / 3000 ms exponential backoff on `SocketTimeoutException` / `408` / `5xx` / `Connection reset`, no retry on `400/401/403/422`. Extended `PREKEY_TRACE` logging (`prekey_publish_start | _ok | _retry | _fail_giving_up | _debounced`). Acceptance: Caddy access log must no longer show `POST /prekeys/publish bytes_read=0 status=408 duration=30s` from the app, and on Tele2 LTE prekey publish must complete without forcing fall-through to Tor purely on publish-timeout grounds.
  - **PR-Diag — transport probe step observability.** Pure logging, no behaviour change. OkHttp `EventListener` on the per-probe client emits `PROBE_TRACE probe_event kind=… event=dnsStart/connectStart/secureConnectStart/secureConnectEnd/responseHeadersStart/callEnd/…` per phase with elapsed-ms. `TransportManager.connect()` emits `chain_start / prepare_start / prepare_done / prepare_fail / probe_called / probe_returned / probe_outer_timeout / chain_attempt_success / chain_attempt_failed / chain_all_failed`. Tor / Xray state machines stream their states out under the same tag. After this lands, the next field test answers "which phase of which probe died" by reading the log instead of inferring from server-side cross-references.
- **Lesson worth keeping** (added to internal memory). When interpreting a request that timed out on a censored network, check both sides' timing carefully. `bytes_read = 0` on the server **plus** a clean duration that exactly equals the client's `readTimeout` is a **client-side bug signature**, not a network-filter signature. Network filters typically produce more chaotic timing — partial bytes, mid-stream resets, TLS handshake failures, etc. Clean numbers are the OS telling the client one story while doing another. The diagnosis cost was a roughly two-hour detour into multi-VPS deployment planning that the data did not justify — a cheap mistake here because no money was spent, but worth not repeating.
- **Unidentified MTS Irkutsk client `1b51ae78…`.** Caddy log shows this identity from IP `<redacted-client-ip>` (PJSC MTS Irkutsk branch, AS8359) doing `GET /auth/challenge` every ~30 s through HTTP/1.1 Direct, stable for hours. Not one of Vladislav's current test devices. Two possible explanations: an old PHANTOM install on a forgotten device of Vladislav's that retained the SQLCipher identity, or a real-world third-party user that found the build somewhere. Filed as low-priority follow-up to confirm via the relay's JSONL prekey records and either ack or quietly investigate further; **no action that affects this user** until we know which it is.
- **Process notes.**
  - Phase 0 (repo hygiene, seven PRs #135 → #141) is closed and durables are in `master`. Phase 1 was about to start when Test #42 surfaced this. The pause buys us a real bug fix, not lost time.
  - Two architect voices contributed independent reads — both useful, both somewhat wrong in places, both right in the convergent answer. Architect-1 originally flagged the REST-clearnet routing issue; that observation is correct but is the *PR-H1f* concern, not the *PR-R0* fix landing now. Architect-2 read the data tighter and identified Bugs A + B, which is the right scope for the immediate PR.
  - Strategic pivot decision lives in [`memory/project_strategic_pivot_2026_05_15.md`](../); the data-driven correction to that pivot lives in [`memory/diagnostic_tele2_2026_05_15.md`](../). The pivot's *direction* (Tor demoted, Reality for mobile, no calls over Tor) survives. The pivot's *first-action item* changed from "deploy multi-VPS pool" to "fix the OkHttp publish bug first; the data says infra is not the bottleneck yet".
- **Merge update (later same session, 2026-05-15 evening).** Both PRs merged into `master` after first-round CI fix-ups:
  - **PR-Diag — squash-merged as `f3925cac` (#143).** First CI failed with two `e: ... deprecated. moved to val.` errors in `KtorTransportProbe.kt` for `handshake.tlsVersion()` and `handshake.cipherSuite()` (these moved from functions to `val` properties in the OkHttp version pinned by this repo). Follow-up commit `999d18c3` switched both call sites to property access. CI passed second try; squash-merged green.
  - **PR-R0 — squash-merged as `817331a7` (#144).** First CI failed with four Kotlin compile errors in `PreKeyPublishReliabilityTest.kt`: `Unresolved reference 'currentTime'` (×2) and `Argument type mismatch: actual type is 'Long', but 'Double' was expected` (×2). Root cause: `runTest { currentTime }` is provided by an extension that the project's `kotlinx-coroutines-test` version doesn't expose directly, and the 3-arg `assertEquals(Long, Long, String)` call was ambiguous with the `assertEquals(Double, Double, Double, String?)` overload. Follow-up commit `eb0a9c87` switched the two `currentTime` reads to `testScheduler.currentTime` (the always-present underlying `TestCoroutineScheduler` property) and added explicit named `expected = / actual = / message =` parameters on both `assertEquals` calls plus an explicit `Long` type on the `sumOf { … }` result so the generic overload binds cleanly. CI passed second try; squash-merged green.
  - **Repo-hygiene side note.** Mid-session `git add -A` after an inline edit briefly pulled all the local untracked dev-machine junk (`Design/`, `Fonts/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Releases/ToS/…`, `libXray-main-1/`, two PDFs) into the staged set. `git push --force-with-lease` rejected the push as `stale info` and saved the PR from getting 204-files-/-20K-line bloat. After that, every amend used `git add <explicit path>` instead. CLAUDE.md already advises against `add -A`; logged here as a real example of why.
  - **Author identity reconciled.** Earlier commits in the session were authored as `WladislaWLE <felixandterror@gmail.com>` (machine default), while the rest of the repo's recent history uses `Vladislav.L <60427218+LiudvigVladislav@users.noreply.github.com>` so GitHub displays the `LiudvigVladislav` handle. Updated local `git config` mid-session and amended every commit Vladislav was about to merge so the GitHub PR pages and final squash commits all show the same author. CLAUDE.md's "Author identity: Vladislav (`WladislaWLE`)" line is now stale — update there is non-urgent but should happen sometime.
- **What's next (locked at end of this session).** In rough priority order:
  1. **Tele2 LTE Иркутская retest** on the Tecno handset Vladislav owns. Acceptance for PR-R0 is concrete and Caddy-loggable: zero `POST /prekeys/publish` with `bytes_read=0 status=408 duration=30s` from the app's identity for the duration of a fresh session, AND the route-selection logic does NOT drop down to Tor purely because publish kept timing out. PR-Diag's `PROBE_TRACE` lines will make any residual failure cheap to diagnose without SSH.
  2. **`MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md`** updated in the same commit family — `Last updated` line bumped to 2026-05-15, the headline paragraph extended with the Tele2 session findings, strategic-pivot bullet added.
  3. **PR-R1a — `TransportCapabilities` + call gating.** Parallel design track. Tor route → `calls = false, voiceMessages = false (or limited)`; Direct/Reality routes keep all three. If user presses Call while active route is Tor, the UI must say "Calls require Direct or Reality connection. PHANTOM is on text-only Tor fallback." rather than attempt a WebRTC session that cannot work. Design first, no code until the retest confirms PR-R0 holds in the field.
  4. **PR-H1f — REST through active SOCKS proxy.** Defer behind PR-R0 validation. If PR-R0's dedicated client makes publish succeed reliably on Tele2 LTE, the REST-clearnet routing problem becomes a *defence-in-depth* concern rather than a *fix-or-it-doesn't-work* concern. Architect-1's observation is still real; it's just no longer the bottleneck.
  5. **Phase 1 connectivity matrix (Tests #43–#47)** remains **paused** until the Tele2 retest succeeds. The matrix collects data that gets attached to the public `CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX.md` artifact, and collecting that data with a known publish bug present would just produce data we cannot trust.
  6. **Unidentified MTS Irkutsk client `1b51ae78…`** — low-priority follow-up. Confirm via the relay's JSONL prekey records (`services/relay/data/prekeys.jsonl` or wherever the live one is on the VPS) whether this identity is one of Vladislav's old installs or a real third-party user. No action that affects this user until we know which.
  7. **Multi-VPS Reality pool** is **NOT** on the queue. Data did not support that hypothesis. If a future Tele2 / other-carrier retest produces a *different* signature than today's (i.e. one that genuinely points at IP / ASN filtering rather than client-side OkHttp), reopen the discussion then. Free first stop if it does reopen: Oracle Cloud Always Free ARM VM, not paid Hetzner.

### 2026-05-14 (wed) · H1e diagnostic sprint closed — PR #134 merged, repo audit + Phase 0 plan locked

- **Goal.** Take the WS-cycle root-cause question deferred at the end of the H1 line ("why does the wire die every 30–60 s on both МТС cellular **and** emulator-on-dev-Wi-Fi — paths that share no carrier") through a controlled four-run diagnostic on the heartbeat layers, pick the production-best config, ship it on master, then step back and audit the repo as a whole before opening any new sprint. NLnet remains off the table; the working frame is "quality > speed, honest > polished" — no fixed deadlines.
- **PR-H1e diagnostic sprint — four runs on `diag/h1e-ws-ping-experiments`.** Three feature flags added in `RelayTransportConfig.kt` so a single APK build could be attributed via a `transport_diag` log line: `EXPERIMENTAL_WS_PING_INTERVAL_MS`, `EXPERIMENTAL_DISABLE_APP_PING`, `EXPERIMENTAL_DISABLE_ALARM_RECONNECT`. `H1E_MARK` timeline markers (reconnect_start / reconnect_success / ws_ping_timeout) added in `KtorRelayTransport.kt` for tcpdump-pcap correlation. Each run = APK install on Tecno phone (`<redacted-device-serial>`) + emulator (`emulator-5554`), tag-filtered logcat capture to `C:\temp\test38-*.log` … `test41-*.log` for ≥12 reconnect cycles per device.

  | Run | ws_ping | app_ping | Phone avg | Emu avg | Dominant failure |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Run 0  | 15 s | on  | 46.5 s | 39.5 s | mixed (pong-timeout + AlarmManager) |
  | Run B  | 5 s  | on  | 21.8 s | 29.5 s | shorter cycle |
  | Run C  | 15 s | **off** | **72.0 s** | **56.4 s** | OkHttp ping timeout (rare) — winner |
  | Run B+C | 5 s | off | 30.9 s | 29.6 s | OkHttp ping timeout (every ~30 s) |

  Two independent findings, both with paired controls: (1) suppressing the app-level RelayMessage.Ping/Pong loop roughly doubles WS lifetime (Run 0 → Run C); (2) a 5 s OkHttp WS-protocol Ping is itself a kill trigger — the tighter pong window plus the cadence override the gain from (1) (Run B and Run B+C both ≈ 20–30 s).
- **PR #134 — production policy = Run C.** Squash-merge of `diag/h1e-ws-ping-experiments` into master as `bcc501be`. Diff vs master: 3 files changed, +63 / −29. Net effect: `APP_LEVEL_PING_ENABLED = false` new const in `RelayTransportConfig.kt`; OkHttp WS Ping hard-coded to 15 000 ms in `RelayTransportFactory.kt`; AlarmManager proactive reconnect stays enabled (the `EXPERIMENTAL_DISABLE_ALARM_RECONNECT` branch in `PhantomWakeupReceiver.kt` was diagnostic-only and is removed with a net-zero diff vs master). Diagnostic artefacts removed wholesale: all three `EXPERIMENTAL_*` flags, the `transport_diag` connect-line, all three `H1E_MARK` markers. Test #41 (Run B+C) confirmed zero MAC errors / zero ledger-dedup misses / correct FIFO flush across all 12 reconnects on each device — the recovery side of the stack is unchanged by this PR; only the heartbeat policy changes. The diag branch is kept on origin as a reproducible archive of all four runs.
- **Tech debt closed alongside.** Run C is now the lowest-noise WS config we have ever shipped — Phone 72 s average lifetime on Tecno МТС cellular without VPN, which is roughly double the pre-H1e baseline. Architect concurred independently after seeing the four-run table.
- **Repo audit kicked off in parallel with the merge.** With NLnet off the table and the active funding routes being OTF Internet Freedom Fund (submission #22145, ~6–8 weeks to first response) plus FUTO Microgrant (submitted 2026-05-01, ~2–8 weeks), the question shifted from "what is the next sprint" to "is the repo honest and clean enough for a reviewer to walk in cold". Four parallel Explore agents covered (a) repo hygiene + secrets, (b) per-track status across Reliability / Security / Grant-Readiness / Alpha-2 Features, (c) connectivity matrix VPN × no-VPN × transport mode, (d) code-health drift. Cross-checked their reports against `MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md` myself rather than trusting agent claims unverified (agent B was over-optimistic in tone — corrected). Headline findings:
  - **Public-vs-internal split.** Zero secrets in tracked files, `.gitignore` comprehensive, no grant-mentions leaked into `README.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.md` / ADRs / Threat Model. One stale untracked typo file (`-remote --tags origin v0.1.0-alpha.2`) pollutes `git status` — local-delete only, not in repo. ~21 of the 25 remote branches are either fully merged or abandoned and can be pruned; one (`fix/transport-tcp-keepalive`, 3 commits ahead) needs a diff before delete.
  - **Documentation-vs-code drift on TCP keepalive.** PR-H1c shipped `TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE_SECONDS / INTERVAL / COUNT` constants in `RelayTransportConfig.kt` and the server-side socket2 keepalive in `services/relay/src/main.rs`, but **did not** ship the client-side `KeepAliveSocketFactory.kt` that the comment block claims applies the constants on the wire. The comment is currently misleading — to be fixed in Phase 0 PR (a). The `KeepAliveSocketFactory.kt` lives on `fix/transport-tcp-keepalive` (153 lines) and will be either cherry-picked (variant A) or formally dropped (variant B) after Phase 1 connectivity testing yields data on whether OkHttp WS Ping + AlarmManager already cover the case.
  - **FCM contradicts the "no Big Tech metadata" pitch and is currently dormant.** `PhantomFirebaseMessagingService` exists in code with a TODO to register tokens with the relay; google-services plugin is commented out. Vladislav confirmed full removal in Phase 0 PR (b) — class, Manifest entry, plugin references, `libs.versions.toml` line — all to be deleted. UnifiedPush remains the replacement target for Phase 5.
  - **libsignal-client placeholder.** Still in `libs.versions.toml` as a commented-out dependency with "AGPL legal review required" note, despite PHANTOM being committed to custom X3DH / DR / SenderKey on libsodium permanently. The placeholder creates an ongoing question that does not match reality and is to be removed in Phase 0 PR (a).
  - **ADR housekeeping.** ADR-010 + ADR-013 are still marked `proposed` even though their problem statements were closed by PR-H1c + PR-H1e via an alternative approach (inbound-frame liveness + AlarmManager + WS Ping, not the originally-proposed `connectionPool.evictAll()`). ADR-017 number collision: SenderKey signing removal vs Threat Model revision share the slot — Vladislav's call is "SenderKey signing stays ADR-017, Threat Model revision moves to ADR-018". `RECONNECT_MAX_ATTEMPTS @Deprecated` has zero callers and can be removed.
  - **Internal-vs-public docs split.** `docs/project/ACTIVE_SPRINT.md` + `EXECUTION_PLAN_*.md` sit in the public repo as sprint-level scratchpad. Hybrid resolution: move ~70 % (sprint execution, daily notes) to `docs/internal/` under `.gitignore`; keep ~30 % (high-level milestone docs, `MASTER_TIMELINE_2026.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) public so grant reviewers see active project management without reading raw planning chatter.
- **4-phase plan locked for the next 4–6 weeks.**
  - **Phase 0 (this week)** — repo hygiene, three PRs sequenced (a) chore: ADR statuses + remove `@Deprecated` + drop libsignal mention + honest TCP-keepalive comment, (b) chore: remove FCM entirely, (c) docs: internal split + branch prune (21 deletes; keep `fix/transport-tcp-keepalive` until Phase 1 decision). PROJECT_LOG + MASTER_TIMELINE follow-up for PR #134 (this entry) ships **before** the three Phase 0 PRs so the durables are accurate before PR (c) reshuffles `docs/project/`.
  - **Phase 1 (week 2–3)** — honest connectivity baseline. Re-verify Test #6 (Tor on МТС no-VPN) across 3–5 sessions. Run `PRIVACY_MODE_BEHAVIOR.md` Test 15–22 matrix (Standard/Private/Ghost × mode-switch × network-change × Ghost AllFailed) on both devices. Vladislav's explicit addition: prove text messaging is reliable across the matrix, look for further-improvement opportunities, then start voice-message reliability work as the next step. Output: `docs/CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX.md` as a public credibility artifact + TCP-keepalive decision (variant A vs B) by data, not intuition.
  - **Phase 2 (week 4–7)** — voice + calls product quality. Voice MIA retest with the post-H1e transport, PR 2.6 calls audio plumbing (`JavaAudioDeviceModule` + AudioFocus + suppress reconnect during active call), iOS SQLCipher decision (wire it or explicitly document iOS-DB-unencrypted-at-rest in current build), test-coverage gap fill for `PhantomWakeupReceiver` + `TransportManager` mode-switching. OTF response expected during this window.
  - **Phase 3 (week 8+)** — first Alpha-2 feature. Pluggable transports / obfs4 picked over attachments / groups / channels / username directory because of strict alignment with the active OTF censorship-resistance pitch (ADR-015 draft already exists). Other Track D items remain in queue.
- **Strategic decisions locked (Vladislav, 2026-05-14).**
  - Reality+VPN = design, not bug. PR-A2 filter stays. Document "Reality is the no-VPN transport; under system VPN, fallback is Tor" in ARCHITECTURE.md + Settings UI + Threat Model. No PR-A3 research investment unless real user complaints arrive.
  - iOS = Beta milestone, contingent on OTF funding ($40 K → contractor or rented Mac infra). Maintain KMP `iosMain` stubs only; no ad-hoc iOS work.
  - FCM removed entirely from codebase. UnifiedPush is the replacement, scheduled for Phase 5 (~Feb 2027).
  - libsignal-client never integrated. Custom libsodium crypto is the differentiation. Remove placeholder from `libs.versions.toml`.
  - `docs/CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX.md` will be a public artifact (not internal) once Phase 1 testing produces the data — citable, honest, with explicit "untested" cells where applicable.
  - Branch prune policy: 0–2 commits ahead of master → delete blind; 3+ commits ahead → ALWAYS diff first + 1–2-paragraph summary before delete. The `fix/transport-tcp-keepalive` find (a real client-side TCP-keepalive SocketFactory not on master, despite comments claiming it is) is the prototype case for why this rule earns its keep.
- **Engineering cadence agreed.** Sequential engineering phases. Funding outreach (Phase 4) runs in parallel because it is async email / application work that does not consume engineering time. No artificial deadlines; each phase ships when ready, not when a calendar says so.

### 2026-05-13 (tue) · First-message yellow-dot hunt — PR-G3 prekey tracing + PR-G4 REST forced HTTP/1.1

- **Goal.** Test #28 (2026-05-12) reproduced the recurring "yellow dot
  for two minutes on first message to a fresh contact" symptom.
  Earlier hypotheses (timing race during peer onboarding, retry
  cadence too slow, prekey lifecycle never publishing) were all
  rejected once PR-G3 telemetry landed and gave us a clean signal.
- **PR #123 `fix/prekey-publish-tracing-pr-g3`** — observability-only
  diagnostic patch (no behaviour change). Added structured
  `PREKEY_TRACE` logs at every stage of the prekey lifecycle:
  - `PreKeyLifecycleService` — `bootstrap_start/skip/done`,
    `upload_start/ok/fail` with elapsed-ms and reason tag,
    `verify_start/status/republish_triggered`.
  - `PreKeyApiClient` — `http_publish_start/done/fail`,
    `http_bundle_fetch_start/done/fail`, `http_status_start/done/fail`
    with the actual URL and HTTP status code.
  - `DefaultMessagingService` — bundle-fetch path now distinguishes
    `prekey_fetch_result=200|404|timeout|429|http<code>` with
    elapsed-ms; the previous WARN collapsed every failure mode into
    "treated as 404".
- **What the new traces revealed in Test #29.** With a clean wipe and
  emu started before phone, the phone's bundle fetch for the emu
  identity timed out at exactly 8009 ms × 4 in a row; emu's own
  publish hung 20.7 s then 39.5 s before `SocketException: Connection
  reset` from `Http2Reader.readConnectionPreface`. **Yet** the relay
  side's `verify_status` returned `opks_remaining=100` for the same
  identity within 17 s, and a `curl` from the VPS itself fetched the
  bundle in 242 ms (HTTP 200, 634 bytes). Server was healthy
  (`docker stats`: 0.01 % CPU, 2.1 MiB RAM). Caddy access log showed
  the phone's failed bundle GETs **not arriving at Caddy at all** —
  the requests died inside OkHttp before any bytes hit the wire.
  Failed POST publishes from emu were logged with `bytes_read: 0`
  after 30 s and `408 Request Timeout`: client opened the H2 stream,
  sent headers (`Content-Length: 13903`), then never delivered the
  body. **Root cause: OkHttp's HTTP/2 implementation gets stuck on
  REST requests** — both on stream upload (server sees no body) and
  on stale-connection reuse from the pool (request never sent).
- **PR #124 `fix/rest-http1-only-pr-g4`** — one-line behavioural fix:
  pin the REST `OkHttpClient` to `Protocol.HTTP_1_1` only. The WS
  factory was already pinned to H1.1 (Upgrade requires it). iOS uses
  Darwin (URLSession), JVM uses Ktor defaults, both unaffected. Caddy
  speaks both H1.1 and H2; access logs show many H1.1 REST clients
  completing in <2 ms — there is no throughput cost at our request
  volume. Trades H2 multiplexing we do not need for reliability we
  do; if/when we revisit H2 the fix is upstream in OkHttp / Ktor's
  okhttp engine, not patchable from app code.
- **Test #30 (post-PR-G4 retest).**
  - Emu publish bootstrap: **829 ms → 201** (Test #29: 20.7 s + 39.5 s
    timeouts).
  - Phone publish bootstrap: **541 ms → 201** (was already fine on H2,
    still fine on H1.1).
  - Phone fetch emu bundle on first message: **151 ms → 200 OK on the
    first try** (Test #29: 8009 ms timeout × 4, then a sweep eventually
    succeeded ~3 minutes later).
  - First message envelope sent within **484 ms of `send_start`**, no
    DEFERRED, no WAITING. Yellow-dot reproduction step is gone.
- **What is left as tech debt** (not blockers, scoped out of PR-G4):
  - **WS pong timeout cycle every 60–110 s** on both devices. Pong
    drift escalates only after the first envelope is sent (`pong fresh
    9962 ms` → user sends → `pong fresh 40288 ms` → `Pong timeout
    69914 ms`), then `forceReconnect`. Auto-recovery works (re-queue
    + flush + ACK ~200 ms post-reconnect), so messages still arrive,
    but the user sees momentary "lagging" UI. Open as PR-H1
    (WebSocket heartbeat hardening).
  - **One stale-H1.1 case on `verify_status`** (30 053 ms
    `SocketTimeoutException` from `Http1ExchangeCodec`,
    `Caused by: SocketException: Socket closed`). Background path,
    happened once per six-minute test, recovers on next reconnect.
    Low priority — connection-pool tuning, not a behavioural bug.
  - **PR-G5 (UX text + bootstrap gate + fast retry)** proposed by the
    architect earlier — now genuinely cosmetic since PR-G4 fixed the
    underlying race. Deferred until WS stability lands.
- **Process notes.**
  - The architect initially attributed the failure to a peer-publish
    timing race ("recipient publishes ~10 s after sender fetches,
    retry sweep delivers later") and recommended PR-G4 as a fast-retry
    cadence (5 → 10 → 20 → 40 → 60 s). The PR-G3 traces and Caddy
    access logs disproved this: bundle was on the relay before the
    phone's first send, and the relay never saw the failed fetches.
    Recorded as a confirmation of the durable feedback rule
    "diagnose first, do not fix from architectural intuition alone."
  - PR-G3 originally pushed with two files instead of the three
    promised; user caught it, fix-up commit added the third file
    (`PreKeyApiClient.kt`) before the PR went out.
  - PR-G3 first push was stacked on a stale local PR-G1 commit
    (`f373bf44`); GitHub had already squash-merged G1 under a new SHA.
    Rebased `--onto origin/master` to drop the duplicate before PR
    review.
- **Memory + plan implications.**
  - `feedback_seven_times_measure.md` reinforced — PR-G4 flagged a
    diagnose-only retro for one missed pre-push check (PR base
    branch). The 7-point ritual stays mandatory.
  - NLnet is still off the table (decided 2026-05-12); these PRs are
    pure reliability work for other grants and the eventual public
    release.
  - APK output path standardised: `apps/android/build/outputs/apk/debug/`
    is the single source for all in-flight test builds. `Releases/`
    is reserved for signed release builds only.

### 2026-05-13 (tue night) · H1 line closed — PR-H1b + PR-H1c merged, Test #37 verifies stale-socket recovery

- **Goal.** Take the WS pong-timeout cycle (60–110 s on both devices, deferred from the H2 closure entry below) from "auto-recovery works but UI lags" through to a real fix, then verify on real-device twin-emulator + Tecno МТС. Two PRs landed in sequence: PR-H1b (#131, `0baa4196`) for diagnose-only observability, then PR-H1c (#132, `e946caba`) for the actual recovery fix.
- **PR-H1b — diagnose-only WS close-path attribution (#131, `0baa4196`).** Per-session `SessionStats` counter struct on the client (pings_sent, pongs_received, missed_pongs, ping_send_failures, inbound_frames, delivers_received, acks_received, since_last_*_ms). Server-side mirror via per-`conn_id` counter map plus a new `event="session_summary"` log line emitted at unregister with `close_origin` ∈ {"client", "server", "error", "none"}, `close_code`, `close_reason`, `close_error`. Added `closeReason.await()` extraction in the Ktor `webSocket{}` block so we surface the exact close cause. Wire format unchanged; relay required redeploy (done same session). Architect's own diagnose-first push earned its keep — without H1b's data we'd have shipped H1c blind.
- **What Test #35 (post-H1b) revealed.** Server `pings_received=2-5` vs client `pings_sent=11` over 158-s sessions; pong RTT 110 ms right up to instant death; `since_last_ping_ms ≈ 153–160 s` on every `session_summary`. Classic half-open TCP black-hole — middlebox NAT eviction (МТС) + Tecno HiOS aggressive radio park silently drop outbound packets while OS still considers the socket healthy. Architect proposed PONG_TIMEOUT 60 → 90/120 s as mitigation; I pushed back with the data — death is instant not gradual, longer tolerance widens lag without solving root cause. Vladislav agreed; finalised the 6-point H1c scope.
- **PR-H1c — stale-socket recovery (#132, `e946caba`).** Six layers, all in one merge:
  1. **Inbound liveness** (`lastInboundFrameElapsedMs` on the `RelayTransport` interface). The dead-socket watchdog now triggers off ANY inbound frame (Deliver / Ack / Pong / malformed) instead of only Pong — removes a future false-positive class under Tor / Reality where Pong-routing might be selectively dropped while envelope traffic still flows.
  2. **OkHttp WS-protocol Ping at 15 s.** Was `pingInterval(0)` (disabled); now `pingInterval(15, SECONDS)`. OkHttp itself raises `SocketTimeoutException: sent ping but didn't receive pong within 15000ms` when the wire dies, **independent of our app-level Ping**. Test #37 confirmed this is the path that fires first (every 30–46 s).
  3. **`ping_send_failed` → `forceReconnect()` + `break`** (was: log and continue loop). When the OkHttp dispatcher returns `false` from `sendRaw`, the session is dead; abandoning the loop immediately is strictly better than hoping it recovers.
  4. **`TransportState.Reconnecting`** as a distinct state between `Disconnected` and `Connected`. UI can render a soft "Reconnecting…" badge instead of going dark — the connection banner is wired up.
  5. **Proactive AlarmManager reconnect** (`ALARM_STALE_RECONNECT_MS = 45 000`, < `DEAD_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS = 60 000`). The wakeup receiver now compares `lastInboundFrameElapsedMs` and forces a reconnect 25 s **before** the in-process pong watchdog would. In Test #37 OkHttp's own 15 s WS Ping fired first, so this path stayed dormant — but it's the safety net for OEMs where AlarmManager is throttled later.
  6. **Server-side TCP SO_KEEPALIVE on listener sockets** (idle 15 s, interval 5 s, retries 3 → ~30 s wall-clock dead-socket detection). Linux-only via `socket2`'s `set_tcp_keepalive` cfg-gated to `#[cfg(unix)]`; Windows host stays on kernel defaults. Production deploy is Linux container, so server-side kicks in there.
- **Test #37 result (post-PR-H1c, twin-emulator + Tecno МТС, 12 sequential text messages each direction).** Detection time on both devices dropped from ~155 s (Test #35 baseline) to **30–46 s**. Recovery time dropped from ~5 s to **~1 s**. Zero message loss across all reconnect cycles — H2b's processed-envelope ledger fired correctly on re-delivered envelopes (visible as `Duplicate envelope (already in ledger)` log lines, e.g. `0417acfd...` survived a session-3 → session-4 transition without double-decrypt). Reconnect path: OkHttp WS Ping → `SocketTimeoutException` after 15 s of no pong → `ping_send_failed` → `forceReconnect()` → new session in ~1 s → re-queue from `pendingOutbox` sorted by `sequenceTs` (PR-H2a) → flush → ack arrives ~100 ms later. Net UX: momentary "Reconnecting…" badge instead of "lagging" — visible as routine churn rather than an outage. Server-side `session_summary` lines still show `since_last_ping_ms ≈ 153 s` for old sessions because the abandoned TCP socket stays "live" from the kernel's perspective until kernel keepalive surfaces RST — that's zombie hygiene, not a UX defect, and is the proposed PR-H1d follow-up (deferred — see below).
- **Why H1c was shipped before tcpdump root-cause work.** The middlebox is killing the wire every 30–60 s on both МТС cellular AND emulator-on-dev-Wi-Fi — same cycle on environments that share no common carrier path. That points at something in our stack (OkHttp connection pool? TLS renegotiation? HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 WS upgrade?) but the recovery mitigation is independent of that diagnosis. H1c makes the symptom invisible to the user; PR-H1e (diagnostic sprint) will go after the actual cause.
- **Process notes.**
  - Architect's diagnose-first push for H1b was the right call — without per-conn_id `session_summary` lines I'd have shipped a blind heartbeat-tweak fix and missed the half-open pattern entirely.
  - Architect proposed PONG_TIMEOUT widening (60 → 120 s) as the H1c approach; I pushed back with the H1b data, Vladislav backed the data-driven counter-proposal. Recorded as a confirmation that "diagnose first" applies to architect proposals too, not just my own intuition.
  - APK install no-op caught: after PR-H1c push, Test #36 first attempt showed wakeup logs in OLD format (`pong fresh` instead of `wire fresh`) — `adb install -r` is a no-op when versionCode is unchanged. Recommended `adb install -r -d` (downgrade-allowed reinstall) for future iterations on the same versionCode. Test #36 second attempt (with `-d`) produced clean H1c traces; Test #37 confirmed end-to-end.
  - Vladislav explicit feedback recorded: "Зачем ты мне даешь push command, когда это должен делать ты?!" — push/commit/deploy commands now executed by me via Bash tool, not handed to Vladislav as copy-paste shell guides. Only PR URL + Title/Body for copy-paste remains (GitHub UI). Saved as `feedback_execute_dont_dictate.md`.
- **Deferred follow-ups.**
  - **PR-H1d (server-side superseded-close + client-side explicit close)** — proposed by the architect for zombie-session hygiene. **Deferred** by Vladislav decision: H1d improves operational logs/FD pressure but doesn't change user-visible UX (reconnect already 1 s, messages already 100 % delivered, ledger already neutralises duplicates). Will be reconsidered if (a) PR-H1e research finds the cycle is unfixable at root and reconnect storms become permanent architecture reality, or (b) relay starts suffering FD/memory pressure under load.
  - **PR-H1e (root-cause research sprint)** — next priority after this entry. Architect-proposed scope: (A) tcpdump on relay during one dying session — capture FIN / RST / outbound Ping packets / TLS close_notify; (B) WS pingInterval 5 s experiment — does middlebox count 15 s as idle?; (C) disable app-level Ping temporarily, leave only OkHttp WS Ping — four heartbeat layers may trigger DPI as anomaly; (D) force HTTP/1.1 only on WS upgrade (`.protocols(listOf(Protocol.HTTP_1_1))`) — same hypothesis class that fixed REST in PR-G4. Diagnostic, not a fix sprint.
  - **Sprint Voice (post-H1e)** — voice messages MIA bug from the QA-v10 Alpha 1 backlog. Transport is now resilient enough to build voice-chunk streaming on top.

### 2026-05-13 (tue evening) · H2 line closed — PR-H2a + PR-H2a.2 + PR-H2b merged, Test #34 → ledger guard

- **Goal.** Take PR-H2a from "open, awaiting Test #33 retest" through to merge, then react to whatever real-device testing surfaced. Close the H2 line cleanly so reliability work can move on to PR-H1b/c (heartbeat hardening) or back into Track A backlog.
- **PR-H2a merge sequence (`674ce231` master, #127).** Branch landed unchanged from the afternoon push — strict FIFO outbox via per-envelope monotonic `sequenceTs` plus `outboundSendMutex` serializing live-send vs flush. Wire format unchanged (server required no redeploy).
- **7-times-measure caught H2a.2 race before push.** Re-reading `KtorRelayTransport.flushPendingOutbox` after the H2a merge surfaced a leftover race window: `outboundSendMutex` was held only across the snapshot+clear of the outbox, not across the actual `Send` loop. A fresh live `send()` could observe the cleared outbox and race onto the wire with a higher `sequenceTs` than envelopes still being flushed. PR-H2a.2 (`72e59ce9`, #128) extends the mutex hold to span the entire flush-Send loop. Pings and ack-deliveries still bypass (orthogonal to per-conversation ratchet ordering). One additional unit test pinned the new invariant.
- **Test #34 (post-H2a/H2a.2 retest, 10 sequential text messages, both directions).** Wire-reorder MAC failures **gone** — all 10+ text messages delivered AND visible in UI on both devices. But the test surfaced **two MAC errors on read-receipt envelopes** (`5b5c4faa` on phone, `88c27761` on emu). Root cause matched the architect's diagnosis on first read: first decrypt advanced the ratchet chain, ack-deliver was lost when the WS reconnected mid-write, the relay re-delivered the same envelope, the second decrypt MAC-failed because the chain had already advanced.
- **Why the existing duplicate guard didn't catch it.** `messageRepository.getMessageById(...)` only catches user-message envelopes — read-receipts and other control payloads are never inserted into the `messages` table, so they bypassed the guard entirely. This was a structural blind spot, not a regression.
- **PR-H2b — processed-envelope ledger (`7008cf3e`, #129).** New `processed_envelopes` table records every decrypted envelope id regardless of payload type. Guard runs **before** `ratchet.decrypt`, so a redelivered envelope cannot advance the chain a second time. INSERT OR IGNORE for race-safety under concurrent receive coroutines. 8-day TTL sweep (one day longer than the 7-day relay store) inside the existing 24h ticker in `AppContainer`. Marks `PROCESSED` on success and `FAILED_MAC` on decrypt failure (debug column only — no UI surface, per Vladislav's variant-C decision).
- **Migration policy — forward-only N→N+1 (Vladislav decision).** `15.sqm` is CREATE TABLE only, no destructive ops, no `pm clear` required. SQLDelight auto-detected schema version bumped 15 → 16; the table appears in both `Schema.create()` (fresh installs) and `migrateInternal` (upgrade path) of the generated `PhantomDatabaseImpl`.
- **Tests.**
  - `ProcessedEnvelopeRepositoryContractTest` — 6 tests covering `exists`, INSERT OR IGNORE idempotency (second `markProcessed` for the same id is a no-op even with different status/payloadType), TTL sweep boundary, GROUP BY status, `deleteAll`. Run against `FakeProcessedEnvelopeRepository` (in-memory mirror of the SQLDelight impl — same `putIfAbsent` semantics).
  - `DefaultMessagingServiceTest` — 2 new tests: redelivered envelope id with a pre-seeded ledger entry skips decrypt and still acks (relay must drop from store); fresh envelope id passes the guard cleanly. The `FakeRelayTransport.incoming` had to be upgraded from `emptyFlow()` to a `MutableSharedFlow` to actually drive deliveries through the receive coroutine; `buildService()` grew an optional `scope` parameter so idempotency tests can pass `backgroundScope` (the `launchIn(scope)` collector would otherwise leak past the test body and trip `UncompletedCoroutinesError`).
  - All 50 messaging-module JVM tests + 6 storage contract tests green.
- **Process notes.**
  - 7-times-measure earned its keep again — the H2a.2 race would have been a same-day regression had we shipped H2a alone.
  - Architect dialogue stayed predictive: the read-receipt-bypasses-guard diagnosis matched what I'd reproduced from the Test #34 logs before the architect message arrived. No wasted PRs.
  - Defence-in-depth: legacy `messages.id` guard kept after the new ledger guard. The two guards are non-redundant in the first 8 days post-deploy (ledger TTL hasn't accumulated history yet on fresh installs); after that the ledger is sufficient and `messages.id` becomes practically unreachable, but there's no rush to remove it.
  - Branch was `feat/processed-envelope-ledger-pr-h2b`. Solo-author per the durable feedback; `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` footer omitted.

### 2026-05-13 (tue afternoon) · WS observability PR-H1a + Test #31/#32/#33 + PR-H2a strict FIFO outbox

- **Goal.** Closing PR-G4 fixed first-message yellow-dot, but Test #30
  exposed a separate WS-side instability: pong-timeout / forceReconnect
  cycle every ~70 s with envelope reorder symptoms suspected. PR-H1
  was originally scoped as "WS heartbeat hardening"; before patching
  blind we shipped PR-H1a (observability-only) and ran three tests to
  pinpoint the actual failure mode.
- **PR-H1a (commit `3db97b49`, master `6d7d43aa`)** —
  per-WS-session epoch tagging client-side + `conn_id` + `ack_deliver_*`
  trace lines server-side. Every relay log line now carries
  `[gen=N s=M] / conn_id=K`, letting us correlate which WS session
  emitted each ping/ack/envelope and whether ack-deliver frames reach
  the relay on the right `conn_id`. Wire format unchanged; relay
  required redeploy (done same session).
- **Test #31 result (PR-H1a client-only).** Tags ruled out the architect's
  "zombie writer" hypothesis: every client-side `ack_deliver_send` and
  `ping_send` carried the current `[gen s]`, no stale generation traffic
  observed. Server log was still in old format → server-side PR-H1a not
  redeployed yet. Findings ambiguous without server-side `conn_id`.
- **Test #32 (after VPS redeploy of PR-H1a).** Three text messages
  delivered + acked end-to-end with `ack_deliver_received` matching the
  expected `conn_id`. **But two messages MAC-failed on receiver** with
  `Permanent decrypt failure`, which started looking less like transport
  and more like Double Ratchet divergence. Initial hypothesis: app-restart
  race in `save_session`.
- **Test #33 (clean Test #33 protocol — wipe both DBs, restart relay,
  10 sequential messages, no app restarts, no voice burst).** Reproduced
  the MAC-fail cleanly on second exchange. Trace pinpointed the cause:
  - phone encrypted read receipt at chain pos N (01:45:40)
  - phone encrypted user message at chain pos N+1 (01:45:43)
  - both went into a half-dead WS socket (server received neither)
  - 60 s ACK watchdog fired at 01:46:41 → forceReconnect → flush
  - flush sent N+1 BEFORE N on the wire
  - receiver chain key advanced past N+1's MAC key when N+1 arrived
    first → MAC verification error → `ack-deliver`-and-drop → message
    silently lost
  This is a strict-FIFO violation in the outbox/flush path, NOT a
  ratchet implementation bug.
- **Architect dialogue (rejected then refined hypotheses).** The
  architect first proposed `inbound session lookup` (wrong — code
  reads `senderPubKeyHex` correctly via symmetric `deriveConversationId`)
  and `H1b generation guard` (wrong — Test #32+#33 ruled out zombie
  writers). Final agreed cause matched the data: client-side reorder
  during reconnect flush. Vladislav's instinct to push back
  ("sначала проверь код") prevented two wasted PRs.
- **PR-H2a — strict FIFO outbox (this branch, not yet merged).**
  Two-leg fix to make wire order = encrypt order under all paths:
  - **Leg 1: per-envelope monotonic `sequenceTs`** claimed once at
    `send()` entry, preserved through every requeue / re-track
    transition. Both `mergeUnackedIntoOutboxOrdered` (renamed from
    `requeueUnackedToOutboxFront`) and `flushPendingOutbox` snapshot
    sort by `sequenceTs` ASC.
  - **Leg 2: `outboundSendMutex`** serializes live-send vs flush-write.
    Without this guard a fresh live `send()` could observe the outbox
    empty (we just cleared it for the flush snapshot) and race onto the
    wire with a higher `sequenceTs`. Holding the mutex across the entire
    flush-Send loop forces concurrent live sends to defer to the outbox.
    Pings and ack-deliveries deliberately bypass this mutex (orthogonal
    to per-conversation ratchet ordering).
  - 5 unit tests in `KtorRelayTransportFifoTest`: Test #33 layout,
    interleaved sources, no-op-on-empty, adversarial out-of-order
    insertion, live-send-defers-to-outbox-during-flush.
  - **Wire format unchanged.** `sequenceTs` is purely client-side.
    Server requires no redeploy.
- **Out of scope (deferred to PR-H2b).** Skipped-message-keys in the
  ratchet + bounded retry on MAC error + dead-letter log. Without
  skip-keys any network-layer reorder (TCP retransmit pause, multi-path
  mobile, Tor circuit shifts) would still surface as MAC fail. PR-H2a
  closes the client-side reorder source; PR-H2b makes the receiver
  tolerant of any remaining reorder.
- **Process notes.**
  - 7-times-measure caught the H2a.1 race after Vladislav's review
    (architect-style "live send vs flush race" — second mutex layer
    added before push). The original H2a alone would have shipped a
    half-fix that broke under voice burst.
  - PR-H2a code stays solo-author per the durable feedback;
    `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]` footer omitted.
  - Internal-only test accessors (`snapshotOutboxForTest`,
    `seedPendingAckForTest`, `setStateConnectedForTest`, etc.) added
    at the bottom of `KtorRelayTransport`. Marked `internal` so
    sibling modules can't reach them; production callers see no
    new public surface.

### 2026-05-12 (mon) · Transport mini-sprint continued — PR-D (rotation reorder) + Briar bridge research + PR-E (RU-tuned bridges with Google AMP fallback)

- **Goal.** Test #5 (МТС Wi-Fi without VPN, 2026-05-11) showed all four
  PR-C bridge profiles fail to bootstrap; the original "transport story
  closed" framing was wrong because Ghost without VPN on МТС is a key
  scenario for the target audience (RU users without VPN). Continue the
  mini-sprint until either Ghost works or every reasonable code-only
  option is exhausted.
- **Two PRs shipped today:**
  - **PR #112 `feat/tor-rotation-reorder-mts-tuned`** — bridge rotation
    reordered per Test #5 data: `Mixed (600s) → Snowflake (360s) →
    Obfs4 (90s) → Webtunnel (90s)`. Mixed first because it reached
    72 % vs single-PT 10–50 %. Ghost-mode AllFailed copy now reads
    "Tor is blocked or slowed by this network. Try Private/Reality or
    enable a VPN." Documented as ISSUE-016 in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. Test
    #5 retest with PR-D order: Mixed still stalled at 30 %, Snowflake
    at 50 % — confirmed the bridge IPs/fronts themselves are the
    bottleneck, not the rotation order alone.
  - **PR #113 `feat/tor-bridges-from-briar-ru-tuned`** — bridge data
    import from `briar/onionwrapper @ master` (GPL-3 → AGPL-3
    compatible). 4 RU-tuned snowflake entries (`bridges-s-ru` — cdn77
    + Google AMP cache fronted on `www.google.com`), 9 non-default
    obfs4 entries (`bridges-n-zz`, multi-ASN, mixed iat-mode), 1
    meek_lite entry (`bridges-m-zz`, fronted on `www.phpmyadmin.net`).
    New `BridgeProfile.KitchenSink` puts every bridge entry across
    every transport in a single `enableBridges()` call (Briar's
    empirical winning strategy) and is placed first in the rotation.
    Net pool grew from 5 → ~17 bridges per Tor bootstrap attempt.
    Worst-case rotation walk now 21 min (was 19 min).
- **Briar research findings (`briar/onionwrapper` deep-dive,
  2026-05-12).**
  - Briar does NOT have any Tor magic for RU mobile beyond what we
    already do; their stack is functionally a subset of ours plus one
    trick (concat-all-bridges) and the per-country bridge resources.
  - Briar does NOT have a BridgeDB / Moat fetcher either — bridges are
    baked-in resources updated at release time by syncing from the
    Tor Project. Option 3 from Vladislav's Friday plan
    (BridgeDB-on-device fetcher) is therefore deferred — it would be a
    genuine differentiator from Briar but solves a different problem
    (bridge freshness, not RU bootstrap).
  - The real PHANTOM advantage on МТС remains Stage 5E Xray
    REALITY+SOCKS+WSS (Private mode, May 2026-05-07) — Briar has no
    answer to the TSPU 16-KB curtain, and our Reality path cleared
    that curtain definitively. Tor is the secondary path for users
    who specifically want onion routing.
- **Privacy trade-off explicitly accepted (Vladislav A+C, in-chat).**
  Two of the four imported `bridges-s-ru` entries route their
  broker-discovery TLS through Google's AMP cache fronted on
  `www.google.com`. Google sees: client IP making encrypted TLS
  requests in a pattern broadly classifiable as "Snowflake-style
  broker discovery". Google does NOT see: PHANTOM identity, onion
  address, contacts, or message content (actual Tor circuit traffic
  flows over WebRTC DataChannel directly to a volunteer browser
  proxy, not through Google). The previous `vuejs.org`/Netlify
  fronting saw exactly the same pattern Google now sees — privacy
  property unchanged in kind, Google's value here is resilience
  against censorship. This is the same pattern Tor Browser ships by
  default for RU users and that Briar ships in `bridges-s-ru`. Both
  KNOWN_ISSUES ISSUE-016 and the source-level KDoc on
  `SnowflakeBridges.RU_TUNED` carry an explicit "what Google sees /
  does not see / what TSPU sees" matrix.
- **🎉 BREAKTHROUGH — Ghost on МТС WITHOUT VPN now works.** Test #6
  (2026-05-11 21:25-21:32 МТС Wi-Fi, no VPN, Tecno Spark Go) reached
  `Online via Tor · Ghost` in **~6 minutes** end-to-end on the very
  first KitchenSink (1/4) attempt — bootstrap walked 0 % → 30 % in
  one second, stalled at 50 % for ~5 min while Tor built guard
  circuits, then climbed 50 % → 100 % in another minute. Probe (200
  OK over the onion) and WebSocket handshake both succeeded
  immediately after `Ready`. This is the first time PHANTOM has
  proven Ghost-without-VPN on a Russian carrier network in a captured
  logcat. Compare: PR-D + old snowflake bridges in the same scenario
  timed out at 30 % after 12 minutes; today the 17-bridge Briar-
  imported pool reached 100 % half that fast. The Google-AMP-cache
  snowflake entries in `bridges-s-ru` are the most likely cause of
  the win — TSPU cannot block `www.google.com` without breaking the
  local internet, so the broker-discovery TLS request gets through.
- **Status — closed-success.** Mini-sprint goal "Ghost without VPN
  on МТС at all" achieved on PR-E's bridge data alone, no operations
  work required. KNOWN_ISSUES ISSUE-016 updated from "documented
  limitation" to "now works on bridges imported in PR-E (test #6
  evidence)". Worth a real-world re-verification on a few more
  МТС sessions before claiming production stability — single-test
  caveat noted — but the architecture-side question is answered.
- **Decisions / why:**
  - **Reopened transport mini-sprint after the previous "closed"
    framing.** Vladislav correctly flagged that I had labelled the
    transport story closed when Ghost without VPN was still broken.
    Bias correction noted; transport story remains open until either
    Ghost-without-VPN works or we have explicit user-facing
    explanation of why it cannot in the bridge profile we ship.
  - **Did NOT take Vladislav's plan Options 2 or 4.** Option 2 (deploy
    additional snowflake bridges on non-Hetzner / non-FlokiNET ASN)
    needs VPS budget we don't have right now. Option 4 (test on other
    RU operators — Beeline / Megafon / Tele2) needs a SIM card we
    don't have. Both are good ideas, both deferred to post-NLnet.
  - **Did Options 1 + 3 + 5 from Vladislav's plan.** Option 1 (snowflake
    bridge freshness check) and Option 5 (Briar research) merged into
    PR-E above. Option 3 (BridgeDB-on-device fetcher) deferred — Briar
    research showed Briar doesn't have one either, the value is in the
    bridge data not the fetcher.
- **Files touched (today, beyond yesterday's transport entry).**
  PR-D: `TransportManager.kt` (rotation order + budgets),
  `PhantomMessagingService.kt` (Ghost AllFailed copy), `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`
  (ISSUE-016).
  PR-E: `SnowflakeBridges.kt` (RU_TUNED + DEFAULT refresh + privacy
  KDoc), `OperatorBridges.kt` (OBFS4_NON_DEFAULT), `MeekBridges.kt`
  (new), `TorService.kt` (BridgeProfile.KitchenSink + MeekLite),
  `TorServiceFactory.android.kt` (bridgesFor mapping),
  `TransportManager.kt` (rotation order with KitchenSink first),
  `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (ISSUE-016 PR-E privacy section).
- **Architect involvement.** The PR-D rotation order (Mixed first,
  90 s short budgets for known-stuck PT-only profiles) came directly
  from architect review of the Test #5 logcat. Briar research +
  bridge import (PR-E) was self-directed after Vladislav explicitly
  selected Options 1 + 3 + 5 from the plan.

### 2026-05-11 (sun) · Transport reliability deep-dive — Reality+VPN audit, Tor staged UX, bridge rotation

- **Goal:** turn the May 10–11 cross-device transport tests into shipped fixes.
  Three real symptoms surfaced under MTS Wi-Fi ± VPN: Reality probe under VPN
  failing at the wrong (~10 s) timeout, Tor on МТС stalling for 10+ minutes
  with zero user feedback, and Reality+VPN never reaching the relay edge at all.
  Goal was to land all three in one focused day so the transport story is
  reviewer-ready before further grant-readiness work.
- **What shipped (5 PRs, all merged into master):**
  - **PR #107 `2ad57a09`** — sync Reality outer probe budget (10 s → 30 s) so
    the inner OkHttp callTimeout=20 s is no longer cancelled prematurely; add
    Tor bootstrap percent streaming so logs surface the real stall point
    instead of a silent `Probing(Tor)`; defensive `tor.stop()` on prepare
    failure so a corpse Tor service does not leak between mode switches.
  - **PR #108 `a953d3e4`** — diagnostic-only PR-A1: sync OkHttp inner
    `connect/read/write` timeouts to `callTimeout` so the per-stage 10 s
    defaults stop tripping before our outer ceiling, and add an Android
    `vpnDetector` (NetworkCapabilities `NET_CAPABILITY_NOT_VPN` + `TRANSPORT_VPN`)
    that logs `vpnActive=true|false` on every `connect()`. No behavioural
    change; data-collection step ahead of PR-A2.
  - **PR #109 `75775c00`** — PR-A2: server-side audit on `relay.phntm.pro`
    (Caddy access logs) confirmed Reality probes under VPN do not arrive at
    the relay edge — zero requests in the 20 s probe window for the device's
    VPN exit IP. Cause is below the application layer (VPN egress DPI / MTU /
    Hetzner ingress IDS); fixing it is not in scope. Mitigation: `TransportManager`
    filters Reality out of the chain when `vpnActive=true`. Standard+VPN walks
    `[Direct, Tor]`, Private+VPN walks `[Tor]` only. Saves 20 s of guaranteed-
    failing probe per chain walk under VPN. Documented as ISSUE-015 in
    `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` with the audit narrative.
  - **PR #110 `53a02967`** — PR-B: replace silent `Probing(Tor)` with a staged,
    time-keyed UX. `ManagerState.Probing` carries an optional
    `TorProbingStatus(percent, stage, elapsedMs)`; a 5 s poller advances the
    `TorBootstrapStage` (Initial → Negotiating → Searching → Slow → Throttled)
    even when the percent is stalled, and percent updates push immediate state
    emissions. Notification text becomes "Searching for a reachable route…
    50 % · Ghost" instead of nothing for 7 minutes. Architect-suggested copy
    deliberately avoids "blocked" without certainty.
  - **PR #111 `ed143c60`** — PR-C: bridge profile rotation. Replace the single
    all-of-the-above Tor attempt with sequential `obfs4-only` (180 s) →
    `webtunnel-only` (120 s) → `snowflake-only` (180 s) → `mixed` (240 s) walk.
    `BridgeProfile` enum in commonMain, `TorService.start(profile)` mapped on
    Android to `OperatorBridges` / `SnowflakeBridges`, `tor.stop()` between
    profiles for clean wrapper restart. Total budget 720 s but most users land
    on the first profile in 1–3 min. Notification copy renders
    `"<stage> NN% · obfs4 (1/4) · Ghost"` so the rotation is visible.
- **Audit evidence underpinning PR-A2:** `docker logs --since 12h phantom-caddy`
  on relay.phntm.pro showed every legitimate test client's `/health` request
  in the last 12 hours from real domestic IPs, but **zero entries** in the
  exact 20 s window of Test #3 (МТС Wi-Fi + commercial VPN, identity
  `8c858658b4c426ae`, 22:38:18 UTC 2026-05-10). Same Xray config + same
  network without the VPN succeeds in 0.6 s. Inferred cause is one of
  VPN egress DPI / MTU on the tunnel / Hetzner ingress IDS — the user-visible
  result is identical for all three so the client-side fix is the same.
- **Validation cycles (post-merge smoke):**
  - PR-A1+A2: Test #4 (МТС + VPN) — `vpnActive=true realityFiltered=true
    ordered=[Direct, Tor]` (Standard) and `ordered=[Tor]` (Private) confirmed
    in logs, no Reality probe attempted.
  - PR-B: visual smoke on different network (with VPN) — staged copy walked
    `Negotiating → Searching → Slow → Throttled` with live percent. Tor
    stalled at 73 % in this run and AllFailed at the previous 600 s budget,
    which directly motivated PR-C.
- **Decisions / why:**
  - **Skip Reality under VPN entirely (PR-A2)** — would not retry as
    last-resort because every retry is 20 s of guaranteed waste. Saved as
    durable architectural fact in
    `memory/project_reality_vpn_audit_2026_05_11.md`.
  - **obfs4 first in rotation (not webtunnel as architect originally
    suggested)** — empirical: Test 13 (2026-05-06) showed our WebTunnel
    handshakes hit the TSPU 16-KB curtain on Hetzner-hosted bridges. obfs4
    to FlokiNET has been the most reliable single-PT path on МТС since
    2026-05-09, so it gets the longest budget and goes first.
  - **Per-profile budgets, no single global Tor cap** — old
    `TOR_PREPARE_TIMEOUT_MS = 600 000L` removed. Per-profile budgets dominate.
- **Files touched (sample):** `shared/core/transport/.../TransportManager.kt`,
  `KtorTransportProbe.kt`, `TorService.kt`, `TorServiceFactory.android.kt`,
  `TorServiceFactory.jvm.kt`, `apps/android/.../AppContainer.kt`,
  `PhantomMessagingService.kt`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`,
  `commonTest/.../TransportManagerTest.kt`.
- **Architect involvement:** dispute resolution (5 May architect claim about
  signed-challenge auth + VpnService conflict — both wrong, evidence in PR
  #72 history); audit framing for Reality+VPN; staged Tor UX copy thresholds;
  bridge rotation order recommendation (we adapted it to put obfs4 first
  per our local empirical data).
- **Follow-ups:** (a) Vladislav post-merge smoke test of PR-C — confirm
  rotation actually walks profiles when first profile stalls. (b) Telemetry
  PR (architect's third recommendation) deferred — not blocking for NLnet.
  (c) Resume grant-readiness sprint Phase 1 cleanup once transport story is
  fully smoke-tested.

### 2026-05-08 (thu, late) · F22 QA-pass + MASTER_TIMELINE sync

- **Goal:** verify that the F22 prekey-wrap implementation (PR-1 `6737be91` +
  PR-2 `2bcd891e`) and `SECURITY_ROADMAP.md` (`22f0c30c`) are correct
  end-to-end by running a real-device test with the freshly-merged code.
- **Test scenario:** Vladislav deleted PHANTOM from the Tecno, reinstalled
  from a fresh APK, re-registered, then exchanged text messages and voice
  notes with the emulator. The reinstall forced a fresh keygen — new SPK/OPK
  bytes are generated and stored via the new `AndroidKeystoreBlobCipher` path.
- **Outcomes:**
  - First launch after reinstall: `messagingService is null after init — no
    identity yet, stopping` — expected sentinel. ✅
  - Xray SOCKS5 up, WS connected in ~1 s. ✅
  - Text messages both directions: `sealed=true`, `Decrypt OK`. ✅
  - Voice (audio_chunk): 13+ chunks each direction, all `Decrypt OK`. ✅
  - X3DH bootstrap on emulator: `Bootstrapping recipient session` fired
    correctly for new phone identity; session established without error. ✅
  - Key finding for F22: bootstrap worked → new SPK/OPK private bytes
    (Keystore-wrapped) are correctly unwrapped for X3DH. Production-proven. ✅
  - Call signalling: `call_offer → call_answer → ICE × 4 → call_hangup`. ✅
  - No crashes, no `AndroidRuntime:E`. ✅
- **F22 status:** CLOSED. All three sub-commits merged; QA confirmed on
  physical Tecno (MTS, REALITY/SOCKS) + emulator.
- **MASTER_TIMELINE updated:** Track B item 1 F22 → ✅; Track C phases 2-4 → ✅.
- **Follow-up next session:** Day 14 NLnet draft V2 finalization.

### 2026-05-08 (thu) · Day 1 of council-revised 25-day release-polish plan — Stage 5 closure + Phase 1 cleanup + Firebase rotation + ADR-019

- **Goal:** close all loose ends from yesterday's Stage 5E.B production
  validation, kick off the council-revised 25-day release-polish path
  (target submit day 15 = 2026-05-22, leaving ~10-day buffer before
  the 2026-06-01 release window). Day 1 specifically: restore strict
  Xray routing on the Hetzner server (which had been left in
  diagnostic-relaxed state by yesterday's `7b4ebf77`); ship Track C
  Phase 1 repo cleanup (the live Firebase API key was tracked publicly
  until today); rotate the Firebase key now that it is out of git
  tracking; write ADR-019 capturing the architectural decision behind
  the whole Stage 5E build.
- **Outcomes (four merged PRs in one day):**
  - **Restore strict Xray routing** (#45, commit `d7ba3a41`). Replaced
    the diagnostic single-rule (`VLESS in → freedom out`) with a
    three-rule chain: domain matches `relay.phntm.pro` (with three
    matcher syntaxes layered — `relay.phntm.pro`, `domain:`, `full:` —
    so whichever variant Xray 26.3.27's matcher honours wins) → port
    443 fallback → catchall blackhole. Closes the open-proxy hole.
    Verified end-to-end via Caddy access logs:
    `remote_ip: 172.18.0.7` (docker bridge) means traffic landed
    through Xray, not direct.
  - **Phase 1 repo cleanup** (#46, commits `f07bba8c` + `9b0581dd`).
    `git rm --cached` for `apps/android/google-services.json` (live
    Firebase API key) and `.kotlin/` (76 Kotlin Multiplatform metadata
    cache files). Newly tracked: `docs/project/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS_TODO.md`
    and `docs/project/PHANTOM_ROADMAP_2026.md` (both internal until
    now, Vladislav approved publication for grant-readiness signal).
    `.gitignore` extended with `.mcp.json`, `.kotlin/`,
    `apps/android/google-services.json`, `tag-message.txt`,
    `private/`, and a `*.pdf` blanket with
    `!legal/assets/*.pdf` + `!docs/**/*.pdf` exceptions. The
    follow-up `9b0581dd` made the google-services Gradle plugin
    conditional (`apply false` + later `if (...exists()) apply(...)`)
    so clean-clone CI builds succeed without the Firebase config
    file. Verified: `./gradlew :apps:android:assembleDebug` passed
    in both states (with and without the file present).
  - **Firebase API key SHA-1 restriction logged** (#47, commit
    `ba830353`). Decision-log entry in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`
    documenting the Path-A-vs-Path-B reasoning (restrict by
    package name + signing-cert SHA-1, not full key regeneration —
    full reasoning in the Decision log entry above this one).
    Operator action (the actual restriction in Google Cloud Console)
    completed in parallel: two SHA-1 fingerprints (debug + release)
    added to the auto-created Android API key, plus matching
    SHA-256 fingerprints registered in Firebase Console for
    defence-in-depth (Firebase Auth / App Check / Dynamic Links
    use these independently of API-key restriction).
  - **ADR-019 Xray VLESS+REALITY as outer transport** (#48, commit
    `20e71fbb`). 371-line architectural decision record covering
    context (Stage 5C/5D bridge failure on Hetzner *and* FlokiNET
    on RU MTS), decision (libXray gomobile + Path A server),
    five sub-rationale subsections (why VLESS+REALITY beats
    every obfuscation alternative, why same VPS as relay, why
    in-process libXray, why single shared capability-style UUID,
    why MPL-2.0 + AGPL aggregation is OK), threat-model
    consequences, known limitations (each tied to a planned
    mitigation ADR — 020 adaptive transport, 021 multi-server
    fan-out, 022 iOS XCFramework), implementation plan (lists
    the five Stage 5E commit chains as DONE), production-validated
    test plan, and references. Will anchor the Stage 5E
    architectural narrative in any external write-up of the
    project.
- **Decisions captured:** the Firebase rotation decision (Path A
  restrict vs Path B regenerate) is in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md`
  Decision log section, written today as part of #47.
- **Discoveries / lessons that nearly cost time:**
  - "Phantom not using Xray" red herring (~30 min). When Xray's
    `docker logs phantom-xray` showed only startup messages with no
    accepted-connection lines after a real client connect, the
    instinct was "Phantom bypasses Xray, OkHttp SOCKS proxy bug".
    The actual cause: `access: none` in the Xray log block (added
    yesterday as a security-reviewer finding) intentionally
    disables per-connection logging. Routing was always fine — we
    just had to look at Caddy access logs (`remote_ip` field)
    instead. Captured as a permanent reference in
    `memory/reference_xray_diagnostics.md` so the same time-sink
    doesn't repeat.
  - VPN-on-host vs VPN-on-emulator confusion. Tested Xray on the
    Pixel 8 Pro emulator while Borealis VPN was still active on
    Windows host. Emulator inherits host networking, so the
    "Xray ready" notification was technically correct (local SOCKS
    bound) but no traffic actually went through Xray to the Hetzner
    server (the host VPN intercepted all TCP). Spent ~10 min ruling
    out a code bug before realising it was test-environment
    contamination. Stage 5E architecturally cannot stack with
    another VLESS-based VPN like Borealis — REALITY needs a direct
    TLS-fingerprint path to the cover host.
- **Council session and the revised 25-day plan.** Last night
  (2026-05-07 evening, after the Stage 5E production-validation
  sign-off) I ran a five-advisor LLM Council session on the optimal
  sequencing of the next 25 days of release-polish work without
  burning out the founder. All five lenses converged on a significant
  pivot from the original plan: cut Track B Security Sprint from 4
  items to 1 (F22 only — keystore-wrap SPK/OPK), move the remaining
  findings into a `docs/security/SECURITY_ROADMAP.md` honest-roadmap
  document, ship the Stage 5E demo video on day 3 (one artefact
  serving the README hero + a public write-up + any external review
  context), tag the Alpha-2 release on day 15 with a 10-day buffer
  rather than the last-minute day-25 push. Full synthesis in
  `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/council_2026_05_07_synthesis.md`,
  daily plan in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/plan_25_days_to_release.md`.
  Today (Day 1) executed the Stage 5 closure + Phase 1 cleanup
  + Firebase rotation + ADR-019 leg of that plan.
- **Day 2 next** (Friday 2026-05-09): README polish (License → AGPL,
  Status → Alpha 2, hero line about Stage 5E in the first three
  lines), `funding.json` (external funding portal prerequisite),
  `.github/FUNDING.yml`, and matching fixes to `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
  and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  ~3 hours estimated.
- **Day 3 after that:** demo video for Stage 5E (5-10 min screen
  capture showing Tecno on RU MTS without VPN, plus emulator twin,
  plus Caddy log proof). ~3-4 hours.
- **Follow-ups from today not blocking Day 2:**
  - The Firebase Console SHA-1 fingerprints (defence-in-depth) were
    optional and Vladislav can add them whenever — not on the Day 2
    critical path.
  - `keystores/phantom-release.keystore` backup to off-device
    location is the single critical-asset backup the project does
    not yet have. Captured here so it doesn't get forgotten;
    Vladislav schedules at convenience.

### 2026-05-07 (wed) · Stage 5E (Xray VLESS+REALITY) production-validated

- **Goal:** Finish Stage 5E.B (the Android client side of ADR-018's
  Xray-as-outer-transport plan) and prove end-to-end that PHANTOM works
  on a Russian carrier without VPN, without Orbot, without any
  third-party app. The TSPU "16-kilobyte curtain" — silent throttling
  of TLS streams larger than ~16 KB to flagged datacenter IPs (Hetzner
  confirmed by Test 11/12 on 2026-05-05/06; FlokiNET confirmed by
  Test 13 on 2026-05-06) — had killed the Stage 5C/5D bridge approach
  entirely. Stage 5E mimics a genuine TLS handshake to
  `www.microsoft.com` so the censor classifies the flow as trusted CDN.
- **Outcomes:**
  - **`shared/core/xray/`** — new KMP module exposing
    `XrayService` / `XrayState` (Off/Starting/Ready(socksPort)/Failed),
    `XrayServiceConfig` data class, `OperatorXrayConfig` with the pinned
    REALITY pubkey + shortId + UUID for the Hetzner endpoint, and an
    Android impl that wraps libXray's gomobile JNI. JVM target gets a
    no-op stub. libXray itself (built via the new
    `.github/workflows/build-libxray.yml` workflow) is vendored unpacked
    as `classes.jar` + `libgojni.so` × 4 ABI under
    `src/androidMain/{libs,jniLibs}/` — AGP refuses to bundle a local
    `.aar` inside another AAR, so the four-file split is the canonical
    workaround. ~180 MB committed to git; reroll procedure in
    `src/androidMain/libs/README.md`. Commit `96fcbf1a`.
  - **`PhantomMessagingService` wiring** — `BuildConfig.USE_XRAY` flag
    added alongside `USE_TOR` with a build-time mutual-exclusion check
    (both true → gradle errors immediately). When `USE_XRAY=true`,
    service lazy-constructs Xray, awaits Ready-or-Failed within 30 s,
    hands the localhost SOCKS5 port to `KtorRelayTransport` via the
    same `socksProxyPort` parameter the Tor branch already uses.
    Notification updater extended to surface Xray state. Commit
    `98245f69`.
  - **Server-side Path A** (`deploy/xray/config.json.template` rewrite,
    commit `7b4ebf77` — see Decision log entry below): VLESS routing
    relaxed from strict-domain-match-then-blackhole to
    `inboundTag-only → freedom outbound`, because `domain: ["full:relay.phntm.pro"]`
    silently misses on Xray 26.3.27 even when sniffed SNI visibly equals
    `relay.phntm.pro` in the same log line. With the relaxed rule, plus
    a `dns.hosts` override (`relay.phntm.pro → caddy`) and `access: none`
    in the log block (the latter two folded in from a security-reviewer
    pass), VLESS clients land in the local Caddy container via the
    docker bridge network — no NAT hairpin, no `docker logs` IP leak.
  - **Test 14 (production validation, 2026-05-07 evening):** Tecno on RU
    MTS without VPN ↔ Pixel 8 Pro emulator. After clearing emulator
    storage (the long-standing prekey-bundle bug ate a fresh identity —
    see Follow-ups), text messages `delivered` in 30–100 ms each way;
    5-second voice messages chunked to 5 envelopes of ~55 KB each
    flowed through Xray REALITY with ack `delivered` on every chunk and
    clean `Decrypt OK` on the receiving side. The 55 KB chunk size is
    the critical proof: it is well over the 16 KB curtain threshold,
    bare TLS would have stalled, REALITY masks it as a Microsoft CDN
    stream and the censor passes it.
- **Decisions made:**
  - **Path A (VLESS clients land at clearnet `relay.phntm.pro` on the
    same VPS via docker DNS)** chosen over Path B (server-side Tor →
    onion). Path B would have added 500–800 ms latency and a second
    daemon for defence-in-depth that protects only against an insider
    on the Hetzner Xray container — and that container is the operator's
    own. Decision recorded in commit message `98245f69`.
  - **Single shared client UUID** baked into the APK, treated as a
    *capability* (anyone holding it can use the server) rather than a
    secret tied to identity. Stage 5E's purpose is censorship
    circumvention, not access control — relay-level auth handles abuse
    separately. Rotation playbook in
    `deploy/xray/render-config.sh` header.
  - **Vendor libXray as committed git artefacts** (not Git LFS, not
    fetch-on-build) — earlier we tried "don't commit, instruct
    contributors to download" but Vladislav rightly pointed out that
    creates a reproducibility hole and a bad first impression for any
    contributor cloning the repo. 180 MB one-time cost is acceptable;
    rebuild from `XTLS/libXray@<sha>` is deterministic via the
    workflow.
- **Key commits (all on `feat/tor-stage5-bridges-via-onionwrapper`,
  pushed to origin, **NOT** yet merged to master):**
  - `5cca2976` — workflow `.github/workflows/build-libxray.yml`
  - `f5e21fb3` — workflow audit pass (Go pin, ABI regex, leading-./, SHA-ref fix)
  - `96fcbf1a` — KMP module skeleton + libXray vendoring (15 files, +644 lines + ~180 MB binaries)
  - `98245f69` — `PhantomMessagingService` wiring + Path A server template
  - `7b4ebf77` — diagnostic routing relaxation
- **Follow-ups:**
  - **Prekey republish bug** (pre-existing, surfaced by Stage 5
    testing). Long-offline identity → bundle 404 on `/prekeys/bundle/<peer>`
    → senders' messages stay WAITING forever. Workaround that worked
    today: Clear Data on the offline device → fresh onboarding →
    fresh publish. Permanent fix: client-side retry publish on
    connect when self-bundle is 404, or relay-side fallback to a
    signed-prekey-only bundle when OPK pool is empty. ~1–2 hours.
  - **Restore strict Xray routing** — replace the temporary
    `inboundTag-only` rule with `domain: ["domain:relay.phntm.pro"]`
    (without the `full:` prefix that silently missed) and re-enable
    blackhole-by-default. Server-side, ~30 min plus redeploy.
  - **ADR-019 Xray REALITY rationale** — write it before any external
    write-up needs it: threat model, license posture (MPL-2.0 Xray-core
    aggregation cleanly composable with our AGPL at the docker-compose
    level), Beta-time multi-server fan-out plan. ~1 hour.
  - **PR to master** — open once the three above are done, so master
    doesn't carry the temporarily relaxed routing.

### 2026-04-27 (sat, evening) · Licence hygiene before the Alpha-2 release window

- **Goal:** establish formal AGPL-3.0 licensing across the repo so any
  external reviewer ahead of the 2026-06-01 release window does not see
  absent / ambiguous licensing as a red flag. The user reported a
  perception that the previous LICENSE file carried a Vercel copyright
  (likely a half-remembered reference to the `prototype/web` Next.js
  scaffold); on inspection there was no top-level LICENSE at all,
  which is arguably worse for any external review.
- **Outcomes:** four-commit patch series shipped:
  1. **`e99aac0e`** — `LICENSE` at the repo root: PHANTOM header
     naming Willen LLC + Vladislav Liudvig (both 2026), the AGPL
     grant / warranty paragraph, and the verbatim 661-line GNU
     AGPL-3.0 text fetched from `gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt`.
  2. **`c403b7cf`** — SPDX headers on **121** source files (113 .kt
     + 8 .rs). Format: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`
     and `// Copyright (c) 2026 Willen LLC`. Driven by a small
     idempotent helper `scripts/add-spdx-headers.py` that walks
     `apps/`, `shared/`, `services/`, skips build outputs, checks
     the first 5 lines for an existing SPDX tag before prepending.
     Verified clean by `cargo build --release` (3.56 s) and
     `:apps:android:compileDebugKotlinAndroid`.
  3. **`27cd9bd1`** — `NOTICE` listing every bundled / linked
     third-party dependency with upstream URL and licence: libsodium
     (ISC), Kotlin / kotlinx / Compose Multiplatform / AndroidX /
     Ktor / OkHttp / SQLDelight (Apache-2.0), SQLCipher (BSD 3-Clause),
     tokio / axum / tokio-tungstenite / tower / serde / tracing /
     futures-util (MIT), subtle (BSD 3-Clause), Caddy (Apache-2.0),
     Inter / JetBrains Mono (SIL OFL-1.1, mock-ups only — explicitly
     not bundled).
  4. **`0bc715e1`** — `Releases/README.md` §License updated from the
     "to be finalized" placeholder to the canonical AGPL-3.0 statement
     with rationale (relay-side §13 Remote Network Interaction
     protection) and a commercial-dual-licensing escape hatch contact.
- **Decision:** AGPL-3.0 over GPL-3.0 — recorded in the LICENSE
  commit message and now mirrored in `Releases/README.md` §License.
  See ADR-006 for the original rationale.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - Keep `scripts/add-spdx-headers.py` idempotent — re-run it any
    time new `.kt` / `.rs` files land. Could be wired into a pre-commit
    hook in a later session.
  - The four legal-doc TODOs (lawyer review, GDPR review, RU
    translation review, ownership approval) are unaffected by this
    licence work — they live in `legal/README.md` and remain on the
    Active backlog.

### 2026-04-27 (sat) · QA-v10 polish + RU localisation + correct Russian legal terminology

- **Goal:** Tecno-HiOS input clipping (third attempt), publish themed
  ToS / Privacy Policy at `phntm.pro/terms` and `/privacy`, add EN ⇄ RU
  language switcher, rename Russian "приватность" → "конфиденциальность".
- **Outcomes:**
  - Input clipping **fixed** at root cause: `enableEdgeToEdge()` for
    API < 35 in `MainActivity`. Verified on Tecno HiOS (the chat AND
    Notes screens). `SavedMessagesScreen` also got an explicit
    `windowInsetsPadding(ime ⋃ navigationBars)` since it has no
    Scaffold.
  - `legal/render.py` — stdlib-only Markdown → themed HTML generator.
    PHANTOM design tokens (Surface Deep, Cyan accent, system sans/mono
    stack — no Google Fonts CDN per privacy posture). Brand logo from
    `Claude Design/assets/phantom-logo.png` in header + footer.
  - Caddyfile: `/assets/*` for the logo, `/terms*` and `/privacy*` (EN
    default), `/terms/ru*` and `/privacy/ru*` (Russian, ordered before
    the generic blocks).
  - `docker-compose.yml`: bind-mount `legal/` at `/srv/legal:ro`.
  - Russian terminology pass: "Политика приватности" →
    "Политика конфиденциальности" across MD source, render.py
    LOCALES["ru"], and regenerated HTML. URL `/privacy/ru` unchanged
    (technical, stable).
- **Commits:** `b3629bed`, `09012ab1`, `99a93c41`, `d2320b95`, `f46d2772`,
  `b2056987`, `3d4b0bf8`.
- **Follow-ups:** legal/GDPR/translation reviews still on the TODO list
  (see Active backlog). Locale-aware in-app linking deferred — the
  in-page EN/RU switcher covers the immediate UX gap.

### 2026-04-27 (sat) · Alpha 1 release tagging + production redeploy

- **Goal:** ship Alpha 1 — tag, GitHub Release page, redeploy production
  relay on master.
- **Outcomes:**
  - `v0.1.0-alpha.1` tagged at the merge commit `0246b50f` and pushed.
  - GitHub Release page published with the signed `android-release.apk`
    attached, body taken from `Releases/GITHUB_RELEASE_BODY.md`
    (template committed alongside for reuse).
  - Production redeploy hit two latent bugs: `Dockerfile` sed only
    matched single-line `members = [...]` (workspace had grown to
    multi-line), and the bundled `time = 0.3.47` requires Rust 1.85+
    (image was on rust:1.83). Fixed both: `sed -z` for multi-line
    arrays (`a539695e`), bumped builder image to `rust:1.88-slim-bookworm`
    (`38b20f29`).
  - Three branches merged into master via `--no-ff`:
    `fix/bug-h-libsodium-jni` (everything from the QA sprint, plus
    `chore/assetlinks-real-fingerprint` which was already an ancestor),
    and `docs/initial-drafts` (release-ready public docs).
- **Commits:** `0246b50f` (tag), `4d7d6091`, `01e955fe`, `a539695e`, `38b20f29`.
- **Follow-ups:** Alpha 2 polish items captured as drafts in
  `Releases/GITHUB_ISSUES_DRAFT.md`.

### 2026-04-26 / 04-27 (sun → mon) · 60-second WebSocket reconnect hunt

- **Goal:** chase down the deterministic ~60 s WebSocket disconnect
  cycle that QA-v3 → QA-v8 surfaced. Four false starts, one breakthrough.
- **Outcomes:**
  - **`b14b39ff`**: replace `session.close()` with `session.cancel()` on
    pong/ack timeout. Halved the close-wait but did not fix it — the
    Ktor actor's finally block was still calling graceful close.
  - **`2ee1d08d`**: introduced the `forceCancelAllEngineCalls()`
    expect/actual that calls OkHttp's `dispatcher.cancelAll()`. Bypasses
    the actor entirely. **Major progress** — emulator stopped hanging.
    Phone still cycled.
  - **`846d6bed`**: `cancelAndJoin` between reconnect generations to
    stop stale `pingJob`s from firing on the new socket. Removed the
    "cascade of Pong timeouts" log noise.
  - **`452a0b5e`**: tightened OkHttp `pingInterval` to 8 s and
    `RECONNECT_BASE_DELAY_MS` to 1 s.
  - **`dbd9393c`** (THE FIX): traced the relay-side bug to
    `socket.split()` + tungstenite's auto-PONG queue. Replaced with a
    single `tokio::select!` loop that explicitly answers `Message::Ping`.
    **Pixel emulator went from "every 90 s" to rock-solid for hours.**
  - **`74e6af0a`**: WifiLock + WakeLock for the foreground service.
    Helped some OEM cases but not Tecno HiOS — that's where it became
    clear the remaining issue is OS-level radio parking, not code.
  - **`22a76c22` → `b2447dde`**: the heartbeat experiment that did not
    work and was reverted (see Decision log).
- **Outcome:** stock-Android Wi-Fi connections are stable for hours;
  Tecno HiOS still drops every ~60 s but messages are durable through
  store-and-forward — fix-grade for Alpha 1, real solution scheduled
  for Alpha 2.

### 2026-04-25 (fri) · Onboarding sequence + false-offline badge

- **Goal:** the two non-network bugs surfaced in QA-v5: the WebSocket
  did not connect after the *first* onboarding (only after an app
  restart), and the "Offline — messages queued" banner showed during
  the cold-start window before any connect attempt had happened.
- **Outcomes (commit `5caf61eb`):**
  - `MainActivity.PhantomApp` now re-triggers `startForegroundService(...)`
    from the `OnboardingScreen.onComplete` callback. The service's
    earlier `onStartCommand` had bailed out via `stopSelf()` because
    no identity existed yet.
  - `ConnectionBanner` gates the offline line on a `hasEverConnected`
    flag set the first time `TransportState` transitions to
    `Connecting`/`Connected`.
- **Plus:** `69e87ad8` switched the debug build to default to
  `wss://relay.phntm.pro/ws` instead of a hardcoded LAN IP.

### 2026-04-25 (fri, earlier) · Six bugs from cross-device QA

- **Goal:** stabilise the relay + Android transport based on the
  2026-04-25 morning QA report.
- **Outcomes:** commit `37e1414e` rolls up six fixes:
  outbox `addLast` ordering, `withTimeoutOrNull` on session close,
  `processingLock` deduplication in `handleDeliver`, atomic `conn_id`
  for racing reconnects, exclude `/ws` from `tower-http`'s
  `TimeoutLayer(30s)`, remove Caddy `response_header_timeout 30s`.

### Earlier history

Pre-2026-04-25 work (Этап 2 security, KMP scaffold, deploy artefacts,
groups + Sender Keys, FCM scaffold, etc.) is out of scope for this
log because every fact lives in
[`docs/adr/`](adr/), [`docs/threat-model/`](threat-model/), and the
respective merge commits (`94b6a4d2`, `90a5ec54`, `4425fbda`, `084cd8e2`).
The first session worth tracking here is the QA-driven hardening that
produced Alpha 1.
